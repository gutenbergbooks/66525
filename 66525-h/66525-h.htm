<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>The attitude of mind with which a writer approaches
his subject is the core of his book. My
purpose in recording my observations and impressions
while serving in Siberia is to tell such citizens
of the United States as may be interested some of
the things they may want to know about the Siberians.</p>

<p>This is not a &#8220;war book,&#8221; nor an account of
thrilling deeds, nor a history of our expedition in
Siberia, but a book in which I have attempted to
bring to the public a realization of the difficulties
under which our officers and men performed, and
perform, their duties in that land. These difficulties
are partly inherent in the Siberians themselves,
partly the result of the chaos following the Russian
revolution and Bolshevism, and partly the result of
a lack of policy for Siberia on our part.</p>

<p>The people of the United States undoubtedly feel
sympathy for all Russia, and desire to aid it in some
way; President Wilson, we all know, burdened with
the world war&#8217;s problems, seeks a solution of the
Russian situation which will give the people of Russia
the fullest possible means of attaining national
liberty.</p>

<p>Officers of high rank in Siberia, and correspondents,
came more closely in touch with exalted personages
than did I, who traveled practically alone
and mixed mostly with the peasants. Had I been
with military and civil commissions, traveling in
private cars, I might now have an entirely different
viewpoint on the Siberian problem. I know Siberia
as a land of peasants, rather than as a place where
I met governmental chiefs and heard the discussion
of international policies.</p>

<p>I do not claim to hold the secret of just what
would, or will, bring Siberia an ideal state of affairs
in government. I deal only with what came under
my personal observation, and draw my own conclusions,
with the hope that from my impressions
there may be gathered some hint of a better understanding
of some of the problems which confront
our government.</p>

<p>I have no apology to make for an excessive use
of the first person singular, for it was my intention
as I wrote that the reader should travel with me and
see through my eyes the things he would like to see.
It is not necessary, of course, to agree with my conclusions,
which have no political or other bias, no
animus toward those who have been responsible for
the conduct of the war or who have directed the affairs
of the nation in a time of stress. Where
strong feeling on the Siberian situation is displayed,
it springs from nothing else but a desire to see our
nation acquit itself well in the eyes of Asia and the
world.</p>

<p>I am but a volunteer reporter, attempting, as I
write a report, to inject editorial opinion. I spent
several years in the Far East in our regular army
and as a correspondent, in the period when our arms
were making history on a small scale in the Philippines
and China, so my viewpoint on Asia was not
gained wholly during my stay in Siberia. And I
believe it is time that we get a better understanding
of Asia, and seek to have Asia understand us.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Captain Donald Thompson, the
noted Kansan war-photographer, for the illustrations
in this book.</p>

<small>EXILED TO SIBERIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Let</span> me see your palm!&#8221;</p>

<p>A smiling major thus accosted me in the offices of
the Military Intelligence Division of the General
Staff of the army in Washington the latter part of
July, 1918.</p>

<p>The weather was hot as Billy-be Hanged&mdash;hotter
than I had ever known it in the Philippines, or so
it seemed. It was hotter than the roadstead of Singapore,
hotter than the mud-baked streets of Suez
City, hotter than Malacca Strait.</p>

<p>In former times of tropical soldiering, I had seen
commanding generals working in their undershirts.
But a new discipline pervaded our new army, and
we were imitating the Prussian system, and doing
our best to look and work as secretly as possible in
uniform coats with high stiff collars. We realized
that the more uncomfortable we might feel, the
quicker the war would be won in France.</p>

<p>I gave my limp and perspiring hand to the smiling
major. I suspected that his pleasantry meant that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
I had been selected to pay for the dinner that night
of our own particular little group of plotters against
the Imperial German Government and its agents in
the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to take a long journey,&#8221; said the
major, as he examined the corns on my fingers, which
were the result of soldiering with a pencil. For having
been a cavalryman, the powers that be in Washington
had given me a flat-top desk covered with a
blue sheet of blotting paper, and a swivel chair as a
buffer for my spurs. What I wanted to do was to
cross sabers with the Death Head Hussars, and
maybe get a thrust at the Crown Prince himself.
But when I looked at that blue blotter every morning,
I realized what a terrible war it was, after all&mdash;for
old cavalrymen.</p>

<p>My smiling major sobered suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to take a long journey,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I caught a serious glint in his eyes, and holding
my breath for an instant before I dared speak, I
asked as casually as I could: &#8220;Will it be a sea trip?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another serious examination of the lines in my
palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you,&#8221; I asked, &#8220;see in the delicate hand you
hold any indication that I am to be thrown among
rude and rough soldiers, where a man may swear
with a gentle forbearance without being overheard
by a stenographer who chews gum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said the amateur seer, more serious than
ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; I breathed. &#8220;I have been in your
beautiful city just eight days, and the chef at the
hotel cooks well, but he does not know how to growl,
not being an army cook. Also, this blue blotter is
making me color blind. Have I been ordered to
where bombs are bursting in air?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have. There are a lot of bums in the direction
you are going. Plans have been made to establish
a new front against Germany in Russia. I suggest
that you make your will and go out and buy
some fur mittens. Your orders are to report to
Vladivostok, for duty in Siberia.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat down and turned the electric fan in such a
way that I got its full effect in my face, and tried to
shiver. Siberia! How many times had that word
been heard with feelings of terror by Russians
doomed to exile! Fancy my impressions in mid-summer
in Washington, on being told that I was
going to Siberia! Cold, ice, snow, steppes, wolves,
whiskers, prisons, Cossacks, wild horses, ski&#8217;s and
ovitches! All these things passed in review before
my mind&#8217;s eye against a background of heat waves
rising out of F Street, where the coolest thing in
sight was a traffic policeman near the Treasury
Building, standing on melting asphalt under a white
umbrella which displayed an advertisement of a
nearby soda fountain.</p>

<p>I reached for my blue desk-blotter, tore it in bits,
and hurled the pieces into the waste basket.</p>

<p>The smiling major wandered away to the nether
regions, where they wrote orders which sent American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
soldiers into exile in Siberia, as calmly as they
wrote orders which insisted that all officers keep
their blouses buttoned to their chins in tropical
Washington.</p>

<small>THE SECRET &#8220;GETAWAY&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crossing</span> the continent in our special car, we began
to study Russian, to scan maps of the Russian
Empire, to talk of strategy, and to go on learning
how to be as secret as possible. This last was accomplished
by crowding fifteen officers into one of
the drawing-rooms, and holding in this sweat box,
what the young officer who had taken upon his
shoulders the weight of the Russian campaign, called
&#8220;conferences.&#8221; These conferences did no particular
harm, and so far as I could see, no particular good,
unless it was to make us yearn for cold weather and
more congenial surroundings for our corns.</p>

<p>I am going to call this young officer Smith, not
because I have any animosity toward the well-known
Smith family, but because it is handy. We
also called him &#8220;the oldest living boy scout in the
world.&#8221; And he provided much amusement for us,
as he pinned the big map of the expansive Russian
Empire on the wall of the drawing-room, and discussed
the railroad tunnels around Lake Baikal, and
showed us how we could get round the flank of the
Bolshevist army at Samara.</p>

<p>We were all aware of the fact that General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Graves was going to have a lot of labor taken off
his mind (real, hard-thinking labor), and as Smith
spoke of thousands of versts as readily as if his
mother had kept a boarding house for versts, we
realized that before long we would have plenty of
elbow room. (Incidentally, Smith never left Vladivostok,
and his wide study of Russian geography was
of no use to him except for conversational purposes.)</p>

<p>We began to suspect that this intense interest in
the campaign, before we reached Siberia, was, in
addition to being help for the Chief of Staff of the Siberian
Expedition, making a decided impression on
the son of General Graves, a young major who had
seen and done good fighting in France and wore the
Croix de Guerre, and now was being sent to Siberia.
He attended one conference in that hot drawing-room,
and then, undoubtedly feeling that we
were safe in the hands of Smith, spent the remainder
of his free time in the observation car, which indicated
to us all that he was gifted with an extraordinary
amount of good sense.</p>

<p>Smith on his own responsibility organized a little
general staff, and with a typewriter, wrote orders
about various trifles, covering what the officers and
field clerks should do in Chicago, and what they
should not do, assigning an officer to the duty of
looking after baggage with the serious mien suitable
to ordering a battalion to go over the top at
zero hour, setting forth with maddening exactitude
the minute at which the field clerks would go to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
depot quartermasters in Chicago to buy uniform
caps.</p>

<p>Before reaching San Francisco, Smith wired for
the Intelligence Officer in San Francisco to arrange
for a hotel, for taxicabs to take us to the hotel,
circulated &#8220;memoranda&#8221; among us as to whether
or not we were willing to pay for the taxis he had
ordered, and asking us with paternal care, to signify
the officers with whom we intended to share
rooms. Some wag suggested discreetly that we
should arrange by wire for a supply of lollypops,
and that we each specify the color desired. Smith
turned a baleful eye in the direction of the wag.</p>

<p>We found that General Graves had sailed ahead
of our arrival. He evidently had not been aware
of the value of Smith&#8217;s counsel. We faced a wait
of three weeks for the transport. We went to our
rooms in the Fairmont, and in the morning Smith
marched us down to the paymaster&#8217;s and handed
us out blanks and set up a table in the corridor of
headquarters of the Western Division, from which
he superintended the signing of our names to our
vouchers. Back at the hotel again, he got the office
of the depot quartermaster on the telephone, and for
three weeks he worried the life out of a patient
major. (This major sailed with us, but for some reason
or other, was assigned to the transport <i>Logan</i>,
while we were assigned to the <i>Sheridan</i>. Likewise by
some peculiar whim of Fate, Major Graves also
sailed in the <i>Logan</i>, though he confided to some of
us that he was sorry not to be with us.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Smith resumed his conferences. His field clerk
would call all our rooms on the telephone and summon
us to secret meetings in Smith&#8217;s room. The
bellboys were much impressed by these gatherings.
They knew we were Intelligence Officers, and they
felt we were up to something which was dark and
mysterious. If they had listened at our locked door
they might have heard Smith advising us to get
smoked goggles, or asking us for the sizes of our
shoes, and whether we preferred our canvas Alaskan
coats lined with yellow or blue felt.</p>

<p>In spite of the burden of these details, Smith managed
to find a professor in a nearby college who
had lived in Japan several years and talked Japanese
fluently. Smith felt that this man would be of
value to the expedition, as we were to serve with
General Otani&#8217;s Japanese divisions.</p>

<p>But the professor had his family in Berkeley, his
position in the college, and was also serving in an
advisory capacity for the local Board of Trade in
Japanese commercial matters. He could not afford
to leave home unless assured a good salary.</p>

<p>Smith, we understood, had said that if the professor
would go, he would be given the rank of
major, and instead of being classed as an interpreter,
would have the title of &#8220;advisor&#8221; or something
of that sort, to the American Expeditionary
Forces in Siberia.</p>

<p>But in the short time before our departure, Smith
asked Washington to authorize the engaging of the
professor as a field clerk, when Smith had brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the urgency of the matter to the attention of a public-spirited
citizen of San Francisco, who put to
the professor&#8217;s credit in a local bank some two
thousand dollars to insure him an adequate income
in addition to the pay as field clerk. So the professor
went with us.</p>

<p>As the sailing date approached, and we had finished
buying clothing and equipment suitable for a
polar expedition, Smith became more secretive than
ever. The night of the first of September he called
a last conference, in which he issued envelopes containing
tags for our heavy baggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he announced, looking at us over
his glasses in his room, strewn with Red Cross gifts
for us, &#8220;the name of our transport is the <i>Sheridan</i>.
In these envelopes are the tags, with the name of
the ship. The envelopes serve to conceal the name
of the transport, and will not be removed from the
tags till the baggage is inside the enclosure of the
transport dock. You will not disclose to any person
the name of the transport. And I have ordered
taxicabs to be at the hotel at nine in the morning.
All officers will appear on the hotel veranda at that
hour, with their hand baggage, and ready to get into
the taxicabs. The drivers have been told that they
are to take us to the ferry building, but at the last
minute I will tell them that we are to go to the transport
dock. I have assigned the officers in pairs to
each cab, and as I call the number of the cab, the
officers assigned to it, will enter it, and then wait
for the order to move out. Is that satisfactory?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>Trying to keep our faces straight, we decided we
were suited. Then the wag in the party asked if
we were to keep secret from the hotel management
the fact that we were departing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly,&#8221; said Smith, swallowing bait,
line and sinker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suggest,&#8221; said the wag, &#8220;that we do not
pay our hotel bills. That would be the proper procedure,
to keep it all dark and secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd,&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;Of course we
will pay our bills in the morning at the last minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the wag, &#8220;that after all, the clerk
looks like a loyal American citizen, and can be
trusted. And as the <i>Sheridan</i> is at the dock, in plain
sight of the hotel and such of San Francisco as cares
to go and look at it, we will have to take the chance
that the day after it sails, it will not be missed&mdash;or
folks will think it has gone up to Mare Island Navy
Yard to be painted or something. That, however,
is one of the hazards of war&mdash;we must risk the deductions
of the local amateur sleuths and spies of
the Kaiser.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; said Smith, and handed him the
sealed envelopes for baggage, with the tag-string
sticking out a slit in the end.</p>

<p>In the morning the porter took out my bedding-roll
and lockers, and moved my grip to the hotel
veranda. He looked at the envelopes, seeking the
destination of the baggage, but I coldly informed
him that an army truck would take them from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
baggage entrance of the hotel, and he need not
worry. He felt relieved.</p>

<p>I went to the desk and asked for my bill. A
prosperous citizen asked the clerk when the next
trans-Pacific ship sailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; said the clerk. &#8220;There is some
ship sailing to-day, because there are a lot of officers
here going to Siberia. That&#8217;s their baggage out
on the porch. But probably they are going in the
transport <i>Sheridan</i> or <i>Logan</i>&mdash;I understand they
sail to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk did not know it, but I felt like shooting
him. At least something should be done about
it. We had done our best to be secret, and here he
was telling a perfect stranger with a diamond in his
tie and wearing most suspicious spats, the fact that
this was the regular sailing date for transports from
San Francisco, and that we were going to Siberia.
But I paid my bill, and gave a bellboy a quarter just
to show there were no hard feelings.</p>

<p>Outside on the veranda I found the officers standing
about with their luggage, the center of an interested
group of civilians, and drawn up in a semi-circle,
a fleet of taxis. Smith was nervously waiting
my coming. Immediately he began calling out numbers,
and taxis turned in and stopped, and by pairs,
the officers took their places in the vehicles.</p>

<p>Smith then went to the leading driver, and whispered
something to him, got into the leading cab,
and shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow me to the transport dock, fellers,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
bawled the leading driver to the others, and secretly,
a dozen taxis with officers and field clerks,
wheeled out in column. We hoped that the civilians
we passed in California Street and Van Ness
Avenue toward Fort Mason, en route to the transport
dock, would not notice us.</p>

<p>The transports <i>Dix</i>, <i>Sheridan</i> and <i>Logan</i> were at
the piers, the latter with naval guns mounted forward,
the <i>Sheridan</i> with field-pieces lashed on the
forecastle-head, and machine-guns on the after
bridge. Blue Peters, the signal-flags which announce
that a vessel sails that day, hung limply from the
fore-trucks of the <i>Sheridan</i> and <i>Logan</i>. The troops
to go with us marched in from nearby military posts
all day, and swarms of relatives, friends and sightseers,
gathered on the hills near Fort Mason to
watch the transports.</p>

<p>It was all a matter of regular routine to the dock-workers.
The Pacific transports had been sailing
on their regular schedule to the Philippines, Honolulu
and Guam during the war, and looked no different
in their gray paint than they had in the old
days of the Philippine campaigns, except that the
red, white and blue bands were missing from their
funnels.</p>

<p>Smith cautioned us not to leave the dock, and not
to send any messages outside, such as telegrams or
letters. All day our little party stood round in the
sheds and waited, except when they went to the dock-workers&#8217;
mess nearby for lunch. I had occasion to
go aboard the <i>Sheridan</i>, and finding the room to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
which I had been assigned, put a deck-chair by the
door, on the side away from the dock, and spent the
afternoon reading, while Smith kept the others
herded together on the dock.</p>

<p>On five o&#8217;clock in the evening of September 2,
1918, the <i>Sheridan</i> cast off her lines and we pulled
out into the bay, to anchor, with the <i>Logan</i>. At
eight o&#8217;clock, under cover of darkness, the <i>Sheridan</i>
got under way and began moving toward the
Golden Gate. I made out the <i>Logan</i> astern, without
side-lights, but a single light at her mast-head to
mark her position.</p>

<p>We moved out at low speed secretly. As we came
abreast of Fort Scott, we made out red and white
lights ahead, drawing in toward our bows. We had
been careful to burn no lights in our cabins, and refrained
from smoking on deck. We were willing to
do everything to prevent being torpedoed, and we
realized that if we were to sneak away in the night,
we must take every precaution against being discovered.
This was war, you know.</p>

<p>The lights we had seen approaching drew nearer,
until they were close under our port bow. Somebody
said it was a destroyer which was to convoy
us. We now heard the propeller of the strange craft
threshing the water as she stopped her way, and
then a raucous voice bawled at us: &#8220;What ship is
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence from our bridge.</p>

<p>Once more, in tones that could be heard from
Lime Point to City Hall, came the challenge out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
the dark: &#8220;What ship is that?&#8221; And the swaying
red light below took on a baleful gleam.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to answer the blasted fool,&#8221; somebody
growled on the bridge, and a cross voice replied:
&#8220;The <i>Sheridan</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The transport <i>Sheridan</i>,&#8221; came an exasperated
bawl from our bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Proceed to sea,&#8221; was the answer,
and once more the propellers threshed and passed
astern, seeking out the <i>Logan</i>. We now knew the
boat to be a harbor patrol, guarding the entrance
to the bay. We appreciated its protection, and extreme
care for two transports trying to get away
from San Francisco filled with troops. We wondered
if that happened to be the way the Germans
sneaked out of their ports.</p>

<p>Presently we heard the <i>Logan</i> challenged, as we
had been, and the reply from her bridge.</p>

<p>There were still more thrilling things in store
for us. We saw the beam of a searchlight from
Fort Scott playing across the Golden Gate. We expected
that when we came within its range, it would
lift and let us pass. Instead, its beam was turned
full upon us, and stayed on us, lighting up the whole
vessel till it looked like a floating hotel drifting out
to sea. It must have been a wonderful sight from
the hills of San Francisco. We went into the smoking-room,
where the steward had hung bath towels
over the ports to conceal all lights, and lit cigarettes
with due precautions against showing the flash<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of the match. We had to go somewhere to get out
of the glare of that searchlight.</p>

<p>Soon we felt the heave of the Pacific under us,
the engines settled down to their work to twist behind
the miles between us and Vladivostok, and we
were off to the war, feeling as if we had stolen somebody&#8217;s
chickens. We had gotten away about as secretly
as a three-ring circus.</p>

<small>JAPAN TO VLADIVOSTOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> transports put in at Hakodate for coal.
From San Francisco, something had been wrong
with the <i>Logan&#8217;s</i> engines. What it was, she would
neither tell by wireless, nor signal by wig-wag. We
heard everything from a story that German spies
had tangled fish-nets in her propeller, to a yarn
that bearings for her engines had been forgotten on
the dock. But the result was, that the <i>Logan</i>, which
had been armed especially to protect us, lolled behind,
at times dropping below the horizon, and we
slopped around in the Pacific with steerage way,
waiting for her to catch up. This continued day
after day, and we burned deeply into our coal supply.</p>

<p>For some reason, we could not get enough coal
in Hakodate, and after a couple of days, pulled out
for Otaru, Japan, where we stopped another two
days, and went ashore again. When we had exhausted
the sights of the small city, some of us went
on to Sapporo by train, and saw that provincial
capital.</p>

<p>While we were ashore, a typhoon came up, and
the <i>Logan</i> dragged her anchors, and came near to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
piling up on the breakwater. Several Japanese coaling
the transports from barges, were drowned.</p>

<p>On our return from Sapporo we found the roofs
of Otaru rather dislocated, a high wind still blowing,
and no chance to get back to ship that night.
So some of us slept in the native hotel of the town,
and enjoyed the novelty of sitting on the floor for a
Japanese breakfast, while cross crows in a garden
cawed at us and the gold fish swam in the pretty pool
of the court. The rickshawmen gleaned fortunes
from nearly a thousand soldiers on holiday with
plenty of money to spend.</p>

<p>That morning was rainy, and the streets were deep
with mud. Coming down to pay my hotel bill, I
found a tall, lanky Kentuckian in an argument with
the proprietor, who, of course, spoke no English.
The lieutenant in command of the military police,
a man who spoke several languages, was doing his
best to straighten out the difficulty, while the Kentuckian,
in his gray woolen socks, held up a pair of
muddy shoes which he regarded with contempt, the
while displaying a marvellously wicked vocabulary.</p>

<p>I lingered to see what it was all about. The Kentuckian
modified his language in my presence, which
I rather deplored, for it was chilly in that entrance
and his remarks raised the temperature. On entering
a Japanese house or hotel, one must remove
shoes and put on slippers. Some fifteen or twenty
shore-bound soldiers had remained at the hotel.
When they came down in the morning, they found
their heavy marching shoes stiff from the mud of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
previous day, and shrunken. The result was that
the first applicants for shoes in the morning preferred
the larger sizes, and took such as fit them, regardless
of who happened to own them.</p>

<p>The Kentuckian appeared to be the last one down,
and all that was left for him in the way of footwear
was one pair of wet shoes, size six. When I
came to look at his feet, I understood his predicament&mdash;he
wore at least size eleven. I got into a
corner and had a discreet laugh. For years before
I had been in Japan with troops when I was not a
captain, and had some appreciation of the pranks
of the enlisted men.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you ought to do,&#8221; I said, keeping as
straight a face as possible, &#8220;is to get a pair of
Japanese <i>geta</i>, and walk to the ship in them&mdash;they
will keep you out of the mud.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the wooden footwear I pointed out,
with cleats under the soles four inches high, and
snorted, feeling that he could take liberties with
an officer who seemed so neighborly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t hankerin&#8217; none to walk on them damned
stilts, capting,&#8221; he said, and I gave up all ideas
of having any amusement from seeing him navigate
through the mud with his big toes thrust
through the straps of the wooden sandals. Secretly,
I hoped he would attempt it, and lose the sandals in
the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take a rickshaw,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;If you&#8217;re
out of money, I&#8217;ll pay for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t git me to ride in none of them baby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
carriages,&#8221; he said, and holding out the pair of
infantile shoes to the Japanese proprietor, demanded
wrathfully that his own shoes be produced.</p>

<p>&#8220;No got, no got,&#8221; wailed a clerk, distractedly.
The lieutenant of military police once more plunged
into a discourse that sounded as if it might be
Japanese. The audience listened respectfully, but
disclaimed all responsibility for what the soldiers
had done. They had not been able to prevent the
other soldiers from taking the shoes that had been
selected from the collection that morning.</p>

<p>The Kentuckian disgustedly threw the shoes into
a corner and started out. I hailed him and suggested
that he take the shoes with him and exchange
them aboard the transport. He assented doubtfully,
and to the amusement of the Japanese population,
they saw a tall American soldier walking
down the muddy streets in his stockinged feet, carrying
his shoes in his hands, and making an oration.
They were sure the American was mad&mdash;Americans
have such queer ways!</p>

<p>From Otaru we sailed for Vladivostok, crossing
the Sea of Japan. It was foggy weather, and we
proceeded leisurely. The <i>Brooklyn</i>, lying in Vladivostok
harbor, got us by wireless, and the military
staff demanded information as to why we were so
slow. They seemed in great pother and we felt that
we must be desperately needed.</p>

<p>This call for speed puzzled us, for the wireless
flashed news to us that the Bolshevist front had
been pushed back, and was now five thousand miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
from the coast&mdash;at the Volga River. This news
was disappointing for an expedition which was properly
keyed up for immediate action, and was dreaming
of landing under shell-fire or some other dramatic
phase of real war. And the medal-hounds
cursed their luck!</p>

<p>Our first sight of Vladivostok as we sailed up
through the Golden Horn, was of a peaceful city
nestling among craggy hills, but bloated beyond its
natural size by acres of sheeted piles of war-stores.
This great fringe of covered stores resembled mushrooms
which had come up in the night around the
city.</p>

<p>Bluejackets aboard the <i>Brooklyn</i> hailed us with
loving derision as the <i>Sheridan</i> felt her way to the
dock; they joked us about our machine-guns lashed
to our after-bridge, and suggested that we check our
shooting-irons &#8220;at the door&#8221; in order to avoid
trouble.</p>

<p>Our impressions of the people we saw on the
docks were favorable. Friendly-looking Russians
in boots and whiskers, right out of our old school
geographies, and wearing the same belted blouses
we had seen in melodramas about exiles to Siberia,
gathered to watch us disembark. And Cossacks in
sheepskin caps as big as garbage cans, smiled at us
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Immediately the gang-plank was down, one of
the commanding general&#8217;s aides hustled aboard, and
we were sure that now the fateful news was to be
told us&mdash;we must prepare for action immediately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
probably get ready to go those five thousand versts
to the Volga River to which the &#8220;front&#8221; had backed
up. He proved to be a merry chap, with a Harvard
accent, a fine sense of humor, and a swagger stick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been all this time?&#8221; he demanded,
as he shook hands with Major Samuel I.
Johnson, of Hawaii, born in Russia, the officer commanding
troops aboard the transports. We crowded
around, expecting to hear a history-making remark,
once our delay was explained.</p>

<p>Major Johnson suggested that perhaps the delay
might be better explained when the <i>Logan</i>
docked. &#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked, keen for the reason
of the fretting of headquarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s up,&#8221; laughed the aide. &#8220;But we&#8217;re
all gasping for our mail. We thought you&#8217;d never
get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any fighting?&#8221; asked a particularly war-like officer.</p>

<p>The aide laughed merrily and then informed us
of the Intelligence Division that the busiest time we
would have each day would be when we made our
morning toilet. Smith, self-appointed assistant to
the General Staff, almost collapsed at this news.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the price of ham and eggs?&#8221; shouted a
practical-minded doughboy from a porthole to a
soldier on the dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it take us to get into the fighting?&#8221;
persisted one of our belligerent officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the words for &#8216;How much&#8217; in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Rooshan language?&#8221; called a serious-minded machine-gun
corporal to a sergeant ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Skulky stoy,&#8217;&#8221; replied the sergeant, and then
betraying his disgust and disillusionment, added:
&#8220;Aw, you won&#8217;t see no war here&mdash;only thing you&#8217;ll
fight is the grub. Them skirmishes up at Nikolsk
is all over. The Bolsheviki are clear to the Ekaterinburg
front, and still runnin&#8217;. And the only kind
of fool money they got here is postage stamps with
pictures on &#8217;em of the Rooshan Cee-zar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the Rooshans was off that feller for
life,&#8221; said the corporal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that because they put the crusher
on him, they don&#8217;t want him. They don&#8217;t know
their elbers from breakfast without a boss. How
you expect anybody who says &#8216;da-da-da&#8217; for &#8216;yes&#8217; to
have any sense?&#8221;</p>

<p>Who says an army is not supposed to think? Our
army does&mdash;our doughboys in Siberia could have
given pointers to statesmen at home. It is a good
thing to bear in mind.</p>

<p>Somebody asked where we were to be quartered,
and we learned that we had better remain aboard
the transport till quarters could be arranged. Of
course, the officers with troops went to the nearby
stations with their commands, some being sent to
the Suchan Mines, some to Khabarovsk, where were
the headquarters of the Twenty-seventh Infantry,
and others distributed to units stationed along the
railroad. But fifteen officers and fifteen field clerks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of the Intelligence Division had no more homes
than so many jack-rabbits.</p>

<p>The Chief Intelligence Officer came down to the
transport and interviewed us, and gave us a chance
to size him up. He had been in the country several
months, had seen much of the fighting of the Cossack
chiefs against the Bolshevists up the line of the
railroad, and had a good grasp of the situation. But
under our policy of &#8220;non-interference,&#8221; there was
little use for grasping anything&mdash;the chief job was
to keep hands off all Siberian affairs.</p>

<p>That afternoon I rode up to headquarters, passing
through the muddy streets swarming with pigs,
till the Svetlanskaya, Vladivostok&#8217;s main street, was
reached. Then our automobile whizzed up hill and
down dale over this Broadway of Asia, passing soldiers
of many nations en route&mdash;French, Czechs,
Russians, little black Annammites from the French
possessions, Italians, Canadians, British, Japanese,
Cossacks from the Don, the Urals, the Ussuri, the
trans-Baikal, and bluejackets from Japanese, French,
British and American warships in the bay.</p>

<p>The city of Vladivostok itself presented a spectacle
that would have brought joy to anybody who
yearned for a job as a professional philanthropist.
For &#8220;The Mistress of the East&#8221; had jumped her
population from the normal, which was forty thousand,
to about one hundred and eighty thousand.
Refugee barracks on the edge of the city were filled
with people from the interior. Trains came jammed
to the last shelf against the ceiling, and poured battalions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of travellers into the Trans-Siberian station,
where they settled down to sleep in the corridors
regardless of the throngs marching over
them. They looked like rag-bags come to life&mdash;these
hungry, dirty, tattered people from the hinterland,
a human caravan in a panic. They smelled like a
circus menagerie.</p>

<p>Among them were many typhus victims. Beside
these sick camped the well&mdash;with little complaint&mdash;and
set up housekeeping on any available floor space.
Some who had perhaps an aristocratic taste for privacy,
or who found the air of the waiting-room a
trifle spicy, filtered out to other habitations. There
were, of course, no vacant rooms at the hotels or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Money could not always buy shelter and rarely
seclusion, since the average sleeping chamber accommodated
all the way from five to a dozen persons.
Even billiard tables commanded a good price
as places of repose. And shows lasted till dawn,
so that people who slept in the daytime could be
amused while sitting up all night. Thus, when one-half
of the population got up in the morning, it
met the other half going to bed.</p>

<p>Judging by conditions in Vladivostok, it was obvious
that a terrible state of affairs existed in the hinterland.
The refugees, clamoring for food, said so.
Statistics of food-prices, gleaned from the refugees
as well as from the inland press, proved a state of
famine.</p>

<p>The Svetlanskaya is along a bench of the hills over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
the city, and affords a fine view of the harbor. Our
headquarters were in a store-building close to the
bay, across from the department store of Kunst
and Albers, the chief mercantile organization of
Siberia, with chain stores in the principal cities. The
building our <i>stab</i>, or staff, occupied, was a brick
structure of two stories and basement, and resembled
a library building. It had been used as offices and
store-rooms by Kunst and Albers.</p>

<p>When I reported, I was told that I could register
at the base, from which I had come. Back at the
base they told me to register at headquarters, so
I never did register, but went back aboard the transport.</p>

<p>That night I received orders to proceed to all
stations, under verbal orders of the commanding
general, and in connection with certain intelligence
work, to call the attention of the troops to the Third
Liberty Loan. A Russian-speaking orderly from
our own army, with an unpronounceable name, was
assigned to me. I called him Brown. I was told
that I must have my baggage aboard a troop-train
leaving the base at eight o&#8217;clock that night for Khabarovsk,
but that I could board the train at ten
o&#8217;clock at the city station of the trans-Siberian.</p>

<p>Having no quarters, I put all my possessions, consisting
of bedding-roll and two lockers, into a box-car
of the train with the aid of field clerks and German
war-prisoners. We got it out of the transport
and aboard the train at the last minute&mdash;or what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
I thought was the last minute. I was later to learn
that there is no necessity for hurry in Siberia.</p>

<p>But the train did not come out of the yards to
the depot. Not that anything was wrong; it was
simply that the engine failed to appear. All through
the frozen night, a couple of locomotives wheezed
up and down and whistled signals. Russian railroad
men blew horns interminably, and there was
every evidence of laudable activity. The American
major who was to have charge of the train delivered
a line of profanity with all the fervor and efficiency
of the old regular army. But the Russian
station officials&mdash;lay down on benches and went to
sleep!</p>

<p>It was five o&#8217;clock in the morning before that
troop-train of box-cars rattled up to the station, and
another hour of horn-blowing and whistling before
we were finally under way. Then we blew out the
guttering candles and lay down on a shelf in a dirty
car.</p>

<small>TOWARD KHABAROVSK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> morning dawned, we found ourselves rolling
along at about ten miles an hour over a plain,
with wooded hills in the distance. The fields were
brown and sere, for it was then the first week in
October, and the air was feeling the first chill of
winter.</p>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock we reached Nikolsk-Ussuri,
where the railroad splits, one track, the Chinese
Eastern, going across Manchuria to the Siberian
border, and the other, the one we were to follow,
proceeding to the north through the Maritime
Provinces as far as Khabarovsk, where it crosses the
Amur River north of that city, and then runs to
the northwest well inside the Siberian border, with
a branch line running down to Blagoveschench. The
main line then goes to Kerak, and crossing the
Shilka River, joins up with the Chinese Eastern
over Manchuria, at Karimska, a few versts to the
southeast of Chita, capital of the province of Trans-Baikal.</p>

<p>At Nikolsk, as it is commonly called, I had my
first experience with a station restaurant. There
was a Japanese troop-train in the yards, also a train<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
with Chinese troops. Our six hundred odd soldiers
had their own kitchen-cars and messed while the
train stopped. After their night on shelves built
into the box-cars, they were glad for a chance to
stretch their legs and exchange pleasantries with
their friends in other cars.</p>

<p>The station restaurant was thronged. My orderly
went with me, and we pushed our way through
crowds of refugees, Cossacks, Japanese officers and
all the motley crew assembled there and clamoring
for food. We managed to get some cabbage soup,
which we had to defend against the flies, for no one
ever kills or traps a fly in Siberia.</p>

<p>The city itself is a couple of versts from the
station, for when the railroad was built it appears
that the engineers took every precaution against
getting too close to cities; they simply laid out their
lines for the right of way, and if the city happened
to be near, well and good; if not, the city would
have to come to the railroad.</p>

<p>It was here that I realized for the first time how
vague and unlimited is the Russian word <i>Sichass</i>,
which means anything from presently to some time
in the dim future. I desired to visit the city, to look
over the German war-prisoner camp, to investigate
the train full of Bolshevist prisoners, including men,
women and children. But our Russian conductor,
drinking tea in the station, warned us that our train
would move &#8220;<i>Sichass</i>&#8221;, so I went back to my car
and waited, not daring to get far away.</p>

<p>We were there for several hours. Russians came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
and looked at us, and we looked at them. They
regarded us with friendly eye, but scowled and muttered
when they encountered a Japanese soldier. It
was apparent that the wounds of the Russo-Japanese
war are not fully healed, and in the face of the
hatred which meets the Japanese at every turn in
Siberia, the little soldiers from Nippon display a
splendid discipline. We heard that this discipline is
limited to places where their conduct is under observation.</p>

<p>Every minute, during the time our train lay in the
yards, it appeared that departure was imminent.
A bell at the station tolled once, and the conductor
and engineer blew horns at each other. Presently
the engine whistled.</p>

<p>In half an hour or so, two bells tolled from the
station, which caused the conductor and engineer
to break out their tooting again. This done, they
finally decided to load the engine tender with wood,
and leaving the job to a pair of Chinese coolies, went
away to the station to have another round of tea.
In another half hour, they were back, three bells toll,
the conductor unfolds carefully a green flag and
waves it, rolls it up, and pulls a big bottle of snuff
from his boot-leg. Having regaled himself, and
sneezed solemnly, he blows his horn again, the engine
toots, and after a while, the train moves reluctantly.</p>

<p>Our train stopped on the plains to have ashes
drawn from the fire-box. The train crew made tea
and lunched. When there was no more tea to drink,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and no more gossip to talk, we moved along again.</p>

<p>We stopped eight hours at one station. After
two hours waiting, we attempted to ascertain the
cause of the delay. It appeared that the engineer
had some friends in that town, and had gone away
to drink tea. How soon might we be expected to
proceed? &#8220;Sichass.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first this sort of thing is a joke to the stranger
in Siberia, in time it becomes an exasperation, but
finally you learn to submit and become a Russian,
and take no count of the passage of time. Their
utter abhorrence for anything approaching a definite
statement is most puzzling.</p>

<p>For instance, if they know the exact time a train
is supposed to arrive or depart, they refrain from
telling the traveler. Some say this is a natural
characteristic of the people. I ascribe it to fear of
being blamed if there is a delay caused by circumstances
over which they have no control.</p>

<p>Under the old r&eacute;gime, if a station-master or a conductor,
stated that something was going to happen
at a certain time, and it did not happen, they might
be whipped or otherwise mistreated by superiors
for telling a lie. So they transfer the worry of
delay to the traveler, and keep their own skirts clear
of trouble.</p>

<p>There is another fact which must be considered,
and that is, that to men in prison, time means little.
Next week, or next month or next year, will do as
well to perform some duty. Siberia was a great
prison, and this disregard of time must be in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
blood. Ordinarily the Russian is most affable and
hospitable, once he knows you for a friend, but to
a stranger, his attitude is most impersonal and careless.</p>

<p>As the train stopped from one to fifteen hours at
every station, I was able to spend considerable time
in the various depots. Their restaurants were
thronged with &#8220;famine-stricken&#8221; peasants, weighing
some three hundred pounds gross each, enthusiastically
discussing freedom&mdash;the while they sprayed
themselves with cabbage soup. Hunger! I never
want to look upon such hunger again! More: Never
again do I want to hear it. (Who would guess that
goulash is a high explosive?)</p>

<p>Eat! I will back the Russians as eaters against
any other race of eaters in the world. The way an
average Siberian can mistreat roasted partridges,
hunks of defenseless beef, and loaves of pneumatic
rye bread is painful to recall. Their cruelty lies
chiefly in the fact that they insist upon talking while
they eat. The Siberian is the champion three-ring
talker of the universe. He talks politics so well
that he can prove himself a liar&mdash;then start all over
again, which explains why he has to call for outside
help in order to settle anything. And if the outsider
asks him to stop talking and do something, it
makes him mad.</p>

<p>Why work when one can talk? Work is for
slaves. Only the Chinese and the women work,
(Apparently these are not free). Talk is the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
product of Russian activity along the trans-Siberian.
When combined with gastronomics it is thrilling.</p>

<p>The Allied officers in Siberia were misled as to
the character of Siberians who appeared to be mere
louts, dressed out of the rag-bag. In particular, the
Americans in Siberia were inclined to judge the people
with whom they came in contact by the standards
of dress in the United States. But the Siberian who
looks like an animated scare-crow may be playing
international poker. And he is willing to let us laugh
at him if he can fool us.</p>

<p>These days in Siberia, it is a mistake to think
that because a man has on old clothes he is poor or
not educated, or unskilful in intrigue. For&mdash;he may
be dressed badly in order to protect himself from
the Bolshevists; or he may himself be a Bolshevist,
and his apparent beggary makes him appear harmless.</p>

<p>I found that a surprisingly large number of Siberians
(drosky-drivers, station-restaurant attendants,
brakemen and many others who might be
easily mistaken for <i>moujiks</i>) can speak good English&mdash;but
will carry on long conversations through
an interpreter! One man who had used these tactics,
later on leaned down in a station to stroke a
cat, saying, &#8220;Hello, kitty, where did you come
from?&#8221; Such men invariably wanted information
as to how many American troops had landed at
Vladivostok, and what we were planning to do.</p>

<p>We were terribly handicapped by having to depend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
upon interpreters; I had one Russian-American
soldier-interpreter who carried on a conversation of
some twenty minutes with a Russian from whom
I sought information and when I asked what was
being said was told that the Russian &#8220;wasn&#8217;t saying
anything which was worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t know that standing with me listening
to the conversation was a British officer who
spoke Russian perfectly who then informed me that
my soldier and the Russian had discussed the
United States and the American expedition in Russia
in the most uncomplimentary terms.</p>

<p>Later on my soldier admitted that he agreed with
the Russian in a diatribe against the United States,
but that he had done so for the purpose of drawing
the other fellow out and getting his ideas. He excused
his telling me that the conversation had been
of a nature that could not interest me because he
did not think I was interested in knowing that this
particular Russian regarded the United States as a
nation of capitalists, and as such the enemy of all
Russians. And all the time these Russians continued
to smile and bow and assure us of their
friendship and their appreciation of what the United
States was trying to do to reunite Russia and build
it up as a democratic nation.</p>

<p>In fact, the Allies in Siberia have been surrounded
by an army without uniforms or other visible
military equipment, without any apparent machinery
of organization. This army has the ability to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
vanish without being missed, to reassemble when
and where it chooses, to set up a front if it so desires,
or, if it sees fit, to dissolve again, concealing
itself once more under the wings of the very host
which is seeking to overcome it. To a very large
extent it is an army of passive resistance.</p>

<p>This vanishing army entered the cities occupied
by the Allies, and, in the guise of refugees, or
&#8220;loyal&#8221; Russians, received food, clothing and shelter.
Under the protection of the Allied guns, it spent the
period of bitter cold weather in comfort, perfecting
its plans for the on-coming Spring, carrying on its
propaganda of hostility against the Interventionists,
and mingling with the troops which had come
half way round the world to render it harmless.</p>

<p>The Bolshevists are operating with a strategy of
organized disorder.</p>

<p>Their vanishing army acquires weapons by various
methods. A truck-load of Kolchak&#8217;s machine-guns
at Omsk disappeared while in transit from one
barracks to another, and the men who were making
the transfer dropped from sight.</p>

<p>Some of our own officers and soldiers know how
the Bolsheviki added to their own supply of pistols.
It has been estimated that ten per cent. of
the American officers traveling with orderlies had
their automatics either taken by stealth or snatched
from the holsters in crowded railroad stations.</p>

<p>One of these officers expostulated with a thief.
&#8220;Here!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;That&#8217;s my gun!&#8221; &#8220;Well,
you&#8217;re wrong,&#8221; was the reply in good English; &#8220;it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
mine, and you&#8217;d better not start any trouble here.&#8221;
It seemed good advice.</p>

<p>One story going the rounds is to the effect that
an American officer of high rank, while pushing his
way through a jam of people in a station, followed
by his orderly, was startled by a cry from the latter.
His pistol was gone!</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221; said the officer, crossly. &#8220;You ought to
know better than to lose your gun! Where did you
wear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Meekly the orderly indicated the position of his
holster on his right hip.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you shouldn&#8217;t wear it so far back,&#8221; growled
the exasperated officer. &#8220;Keep it well to the front
like mine. Look! Here!&#8221; And he slapped his own
holster, worn well to the front on his belt. Then
the red of chagrin spread over his face. &#8220;Lord!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;Mine&#8217;s gone, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another American officer, traveling in the compartment
of a car, had as a traveling companion a
youthful officer ostensibly from a Cossack regiment.
He was a most ingratiating young man, and admired
the Americans for their willing aid to Russia. Our
officer&#8217;s belt and pistol were hanging on a hook. As
the train approached a station, the Cossack rose,
called attention to some aspect of the landscape
outside, and shaking hands with his fellow
traveler, went his way. The pistol also went his
way.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I began to ask myself,
Where is the real front? Now I was suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
of the delays in restaurants, the blocking of trains,
the roundabout droskys, the street-cars that broke
down, the misinformation which sent us astray, the
balking telephones. It appeared like a perfect system
of sabotage&mdash;covert warfare.</p>

<small>BOLSHEVISTS AND BATHS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> slow progress of our train gave me many
opportunities to talk with Siberians who had been
to the United States. Compared to the natives who
had never left home, they were highly intelligent,
but much of their mental agility put them in the class
of people described by Artemas Ward as &#8220;folks who
know a lot that ain&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>

<p>All those who had been to the United States
with whom I talked, said the United States was &#8220;No
good&mdash;a capitalistic country.&#8221;</p>

<p>I frankly asked them why they thought so. They
had worked in the steel mills, the packing-houses
and in the factories, and instead of becoming
&#8220;Americanized&#8221;, as we at home so proudly boast
about our immigrants, they had apparently lived,
worked and talked with groups of their own countrymen,
and outside of picking up enough English
to get along with, had become no more American
than if they had remained in the heart of Siberia.</p>

<p>They had all the patter of the agitators against
the &#8220;capitalistic classes&#8221;, for which they can hardly
be blamed, for from the time they landed on our
shores till they left, they were exploited in various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
ways, every advantage being taken of their ignorance
and helplessness in a strange country.</p>

<p>And when they came to explain why they thought
the United States to be no good, invariably they
backed their original statement with tales of hard
labor for poor pay, and then informed me that the
newspapers of the United States admitted that we
had no democracy, that we were a nation of &#8220;wage
slaves,&#8221; and that revolution was coming soon in my
country.</p>

<p>One of these men had pamphlets issued by a
strike-leader in Lawrence, urging violence against
the mill-owners; clippings from a Chicago paper
which told of deplorable conditions in the districts
inhabited by steel-workers of Pittsburgh and outlining
a plan for improvement. But in reading the
clipping, the Siberian overlooked entirely the fact
that bad conditions were described for the purpose
of guarding against reproducing them, and to take
some action to correct the evils. He read with
understanding only those paragraphs which stated
that conditions were deplorable, and were soon to
be eradicated.</p>

<p>And this paper, fighting editorially against exploitation,
he described as part of our &#8220;capitalistic
press.&#8221; He interpreted its printed protests as mutterings
before a coming revolution. The editor,
undoubtedly striving to aid and uplift the working men,
perhaps never dreamed that what he printed
would be used as propaganda to prove his paper
part of a &#8220;capitalistic press.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Another clipping from a radical sheet printed
in the middle west, described the mounted constabulary
of Pennsylvania, as &#8220;Cossacks, organized and
supported by capitalists, to cut down the workers.&#8221;
This man did not know that this state police force
is maintained and supported by the state&mdash;he read
the caption literally and believed that it was a private
punitive force in the hire of the mill-owners.
He also believed they were Cossacks!</p>

<p>Freedom of the press, and freedom of speech,
are two of our greatest liberties. But when Russians
who have been to the United States, can return
to Siberia and tell the population that we are
worse than Russia, and that we are going to have
a revolution, and read to the people sensational
statements and half-baked and distorted information,
at the same time that we are in that country
trying to prove our friendship for them and asserting
that the United States is a free country, something
is wrong. That is the state of affairs which
confronted us from the first in Siberia.</p>

<p>I do not maintain that our systems are perfect. I
have much sympathy for the &#8220;working classes,&#8221;
having begun life as a boy in a factory, served in the
ranks of the army and before the mast in ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said a Siberian to my interpreter, waving
his hand in the direction of vacant ground near a
small river, &#8220;If the Americans would only build a
factory here for us, and make jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are opposed to capitalism,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;We are fighting it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;If an American built a factory here, it would
take money-capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Russians have burned a lot of factories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If a factory were built here would you burn it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how can you expect a man with money,
which is capital, to come here and build a factory, if
it is likely it would be burned?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pondered this. &#8220;We might only take it away
from him,&#8221; he decided.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Americans do not go round building factories
if they are going to be burned, or taken away
by the workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not,&#8221; he asked. &#8220;All Americans are rich.
They ought to build factories for the poor people,
to give them work. You do it in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a factory to keep running, must make a
profit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We do not believe in profits,&#8221; he said, his face
lighting up at the happy thought that he had met
my arguments.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not believe you need worry much about
them,&#8221; I retorted, and left him scratching his head.</p>

<p>As we proceeded north, stopping occasionally at
vast wood-piles to replenish our engine, we crossed
limitless plains.</p>

<p>I had a paper from home. It contained an editorial
on the menace of famine in Siberia. I read
it. Then I looked out of the window&mdash;and tears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
came to my eyes. Famine! There it was! From
horizon to horizon, on either side of the train,
stretched vast plains dotted with shocks of wheat&mdash;unthreshed
wheat.</p>

<p>The sight of that wheat made me shudder. It reminded
me of the fact that the people at home, bless
their Christmas-tree souls, were conserving wheat,
and sending some to the starving proletariat of Siberia
to cure them of Bolshevism. What the various
governments struggling with the problem did not
realize was that the Siberians were also conserving
wheat! For the shocks I saw were not a one-year
crop. On those plains were stacked up the crops
of two years!</p>

<p>Some wheat had been threshed. Now and then,
near stations, I saw it piled up in sacks&mdash;acres of
sacks, ten high. The top sacks, as a rule, were rotten,
having been there for months. &#8220;<i>Nitchyvo!</i>
The Americanskys have come, and all will be well.&#8221;
The drosky-drivers fed their horses freely from the
piled grain. The field mice had established their
winter homes in the piles, thus realizing some of the
benefits of Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Why, you ask, was this wheat not moved? The
station sidings were indeed full of freight cars. But
refugees were living in those cars. In other cars
Allied troops were quartered. Troops being moved
required cars. Allied commissions travelling up
and down for political or military reasons used any
remaining engines. Naturally the wheat could not
be moved!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Our train reached Khabarovsk about two o&#8217;clock
in the morning, and we remained in the cars till mess.
Then the troops were turned out in full kit, and
carrying their bulky barrack-bags stuffed with all
their belongings, we began the march to the Russian
barracks some three miles distant.</p>

<p>It was a warm and sunny morning. The roofs
of the city became visible as we tramped up toward
the high ground, covered with the brick barracks
built by the Russian army, and beyond the town
shone the wide reaches of the Amur River. The
city had been captured from Bolshevist forces but
a month before, and the Twenty-seventh Infantry,
under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Morrow had
hastened to get into action with the Japanese, but
arrived too late. The Bolshevist forces resisted up
to a certain point, and then melted away. They became
peasants working in the fields&mdash;and the
Japanese asked these peasants where the Bolshevists
were!</p>

<p>So although Khabarovsk was accustomed to a
large Russian garrison in normal times, and had already
become accustomed to the American doughboy,
our column attracted considerable attention.
And I was sorry that transportation had not been
arranged for the men&#8217;s heavy bags, which they
packed on their shoulders in addition to their regular
marching kits, for six hundred men bent under
baggage, struggling up the hilly roads, do not present
an inspiring spectacle.</p>

<p>We Americans in foreign parts do not seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
care anything for the psychology of the land in which
we are operating; we are intensely practical, and
entirely too sure that the American way of doing
things is the best way, and take no account of the
effect we may create upon foreign peoples&mdash;overlooking
the fact that first impressions are most vital.</p>

<p>Now Asia is a land in which the bearing of burdens
marks one of the lowest caste. The Siberian is
Asiatic in his viewpoint, being so closely in touch with
China and Manchuria. And, as in China, to be seen
carrying heavy burdens when there is no necessity
for it, means that a man&#8217;s standing is ruined; no
matter how smartly he may dress, or how decently
he may comport himself, or what he may do to show
his superiority after he has been seen at what is
considered debasing toil, the Asiatic never forgets
that this foreigner has been a bearer of burdens.
He carries forever that impression in the back of
his head, on occasion dares to be insolent, and
judges by that standard all people of that race.</p>

<p>And to go into Siberia, with an army, claiming
to be a democracy in which all men are free and
equal, yet with men who are &#8220;conscripts&#8221; in the
sense understood by Asia, and then display those
&#8220;conscripts&#8221; doing the work of pack-animals, is
most confusing to the Siberian, the Cossack, the
Chinese, and Japanese. They cannot understand
our assertion that all are equal, or that many men
of the United States have willingly responded to a
&#8220;draft,&#8221; and are willingly submitting themselves
to the orders of their officers in order to maintain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
freedom and equality. We say one thing, and demonstrate
another. I once tried to explain this phenomenon
of all serving the common cause, some in
the ranks and some as officers, to a keen Chinese
servant who had been in Hong Kong and knew
English well. When I had finished, he looked at
me, and reaching for the skillet to fry some eggs,
remarked, sagely: &#8220;You talk lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the regimental band had been at the station
that morning in Khabarovsk, and the heavy baggage
left to be hauled by wagons, and the men had
marched to the barracks under arms with swinging
strides and heads up, it would have been worth several
million dollars to the United States in Asia&mdash;and
worth much to the men themselves. It would
have raised our troops in the estimation of Japanese
and Russians. Instead, our column toiled along,
resting every few hundred yards, and resuming the
march with a series of painful grunts and muttered
curses.</p>

<p>As we climbed the last hill, a flock of geese swung
in ahead of us, and marching in splendid style, led
us to the entrance to the post. There the column
remained in the road for an hour, while the regimental
band came and played in honor of a party of
Japanese statesmen who happened at that time to be
calling on the commandant, Colonel Styer, and making
an inspection of the city. This, of course, was
a necessary and proper honor to pay the guests, and
accounted in part for the fact that we had to arrive
without music; but as the visitors were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
long in the post, our departure from the station
might have been deferred till the music was available.
After eight days in crowded box-cars, that
band was most inspiring when we did hear it, and
the weary doughboys were soon chaffing merrily,
glad to have found their new home.</p>

<p>In discussing these matters, I wish it understood
that I am not criticizing any individual, but the
people of the United States so eager to make a
good showing abroad and to convince foreign peoples
of our good motives and our army so careful
not to offend, seem to need something in the way
of a code to follow so as to learn to put the best
foot forward when away from home.</p>

<p>The British, having had so much more experience
with Asiatics, have learned the value of good impressions,
and by observing what we may consider
trifles, have held and administered the affairs of
many lands in the East more by these trifles than by
actual force of arms.</p>

<p>I know that our attitude has been in the Philippines,
Cuba and elsewhere, &#8220;In time these people
will learn that we mean all right.&#8221; In time they
do. But we send an army into foreign countries
in much the same manner as a man might attend a
first formal dinner in boots, a fishing coat, and a
woolen shirt, and on entering the dining-room, trip
over a rug when preparing to bow to the hostess.
In time, he might establish the fact that he was a
man of some breeding. Most people, both for their
own comfort, and the comfort of hosts, would prefer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to display their breeding first, for some of the
guests might leave before the uncouth one had a
chance to prove that he was not a boor.</p>

<p>Once the details of turning over the reinforcements
were accomplished, with the major who had
commanded the train, I took a drosky, and sought
the best bath-house in the city. How that vehicle
ever held together was a mystery to both of us.
The roads were both rutty and full of yielding
mud, and as we galloped toward town, first one of
us and then the other was in danger of being hurled
out to the black pigs along the streets.</p>

<p>The cost of a &#8220;bolshoi&#8221; or grand bath, was two
rubles each, and being provided with soap and
towels, we were escorted to a room containing an
old sofa and a dressing table weak in the legs. The
attendant brought us a small tub of water, for what
purpose I have not the slightest idea, as the room
adjoining contained a bath-tub of Russian dimensions,
a shower big enough for an elephant, and all
the pipes full of blazing hot water. The Siberian
does not bathe himself&mdash;he parboils himself.</p>

<p>The temperature of both rooms was exceedingly
hot and humid, so that in a few minutes all our
clothing was moist and clammy; and to make matters
worse, the ambitious attendant came in and
hurled buckets of water over the big marble slab,
which was heated by pipes, filling both rooms with a
stifling steam. I opened the windows promptly, to
his great horror, and drove him away as gently as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
possible with the one Russian word I had to fit the
occasion&mdash;&#8220;Scurrai,&#8221; and he scurried.</p>

<p>When I had laid my clothing out on the ancient
sofa, I realized that the place had not been swept
or dusted for a decade. I made a mental picture
of the limitless number of people who had divested
themselves of their garments in that very spot. It
was not such as had gone on their way, clean and
rosy, which worried me, but what they had left behind,
to inhabit temporarily the crevices of the sofa.
So I hastened my bathing under the shower, and
dressed as rapidly as possible, after discreet shakings
of all my wearing apparel.</p>

<p>The clerk below regarded me with surprise when
I went down. He thought I had not bathed at all,
but had come back to make some complaint. He
did not realize that I had hurried to avoid complaints
in the future, when he might not be present
to get the benefit of my vocabulary. I am sure he
thought me most tentative about my bath, and not
a particularly clean man.</p>

<p>It takes the ordinary Siberian about an hour to get
himself properly tender. For some strange reason,
known only to the inscrutable American mind, I had
failed to cook myself a full two rubles worth, and
had surrendered my room to a Chinese who did not
appear to be a regular client, judging from his lack
of grooming.</p>

<p>The major had been as precipitate as myself, having
been duly influenced by my active imagination.
Once more we risked our lives in the drosky.</p>

<small>HETMAN OF THE USSURI</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Khabarovsk</span> is a city of probably sixty thousand
population, and picturesquely situated in a sweeping
bend of the Amur River, its streets being laid on a
bench of land overlooking the river. The barracks
occupied by the American and Japanese forces are
on still higher ground arranged on a plateau, with
the dull reds and browns of the city roofs shining
below.</p>

<p>It is a provincial capital, the most important north
of Vladivostok, and the chief center of the Ussuri
Cossacks. The first thing to catch the eye on the
morning we marched up to the post, was a yellow
flag flying from a pole across a gully from the
American headquarters, with a black and fanciful
lower-case y upon its field. Y in Russian has the
sound of our double o, and so was the initial letter
in Russian for Ussuri, thus the flag marked a Cossack
garrison quartered inside the stockade beyond.</p>

<p class="caption">NIGHT VIEW OF VLADIVOSTOK HARBOR FROM HILL<br /> OF THE CITY</p>

<p>Yellow is a favorite color with the Cossacks.
Their officers wear Prussian blue riding breeches,
with wide yellow stripes, similar to the breeches
worn by our own cavalry officers before the khaki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
days. Their tunics were well-cut, but almost any
color seemed to serve, as long as heavy gold cloth
shoulder straps with elaborate embroidery on them,
could be procured.</p>

<p>Boots and spurs, and the characteristic high busby
of white or black lamb-skin with the wool on, completed
the costume. These bonnets are not always
circular, but are flattened out, and then worn with
the flat sides front and back, and tilted to the rear,
giving a rakish effect. The cloth tops set into the
wool are frequently of gorgeous colors, some being
bright purple, some gold, some red, so viewed from
behind, the Cossack is a colorful personage. Viewed
from the front, on a charging horse, and with lance
or saber point first, they generally get the road to
themselves.</p>

<p>The men of the ranks looked to me more Mongol
than Slav, and resemble somewhat the American
Indian, having high cheek bones, black straight hair
worn rather long, broad but low brows, but their
faces lack the acquilinity of our aborigines. Most
of them struck me as being stolid, stoical persons,
rather sure of their positions as belonging to the warrior
class, and while according to our standards,
inclined to swagger a trifle when among the lower
classes, quiet enough unless interfered with. Among
the Siberian peasants they had the bearing and demeanor
of masters of the situation, and contrasted
with the peasant, I would prefer that the latter have
more self-assertion in a dignified way, rather than
the inevitable skulking manner which they take on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
when they come in contact with persons whom they
recognize as superiors.</p>

<p>Khabarovsk was filled with the men of the local
Cossack hetman, Kalmikoff, known to our forces as
Ataman Kalmikoff, a title which appears to be derived
from the Turkish, just as the name &#8220;Cossack&#8221;
is the Turkish <i>kazak</i>, or robber. The accent falls
upon the last syllable, and the Russian spelling follows
the Turkish, so that &#8220;y k&#8221; worn on the sleeve of
a soldier marked him as an Ussuri Cossack.</p>

<p>I was living in the quarters of Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrow, as his guest, with the regimental adjutant
of the Twenty-seventh Infantry, and a young regimental
supply officer. Colonel Morrow had commanded
the column which hastened to reinforce the
Japanese division in the action south of Khabarovsk,
but the Bolshevists dissolved after a desultory fight,
and the infantry, fresh from the Philippines, did
not get into the battle. At that time Colonel Styer,
commander of the Twenty-seventh, was in Vladivostok
in command of the expedition, General Graves
and his staff not having arrived.</p>

<p>Colonel Styer was now in command of the American
forces at Khabarovsk, and I found him all that
is meant by the term &#8220;an officer and a gentleman.&#8221;
I can say the same of all the officers of the Twenty-seventh
that I had the pleasure of meeting. And
Colonel Morrow, in whose house and company I
spent my pleasantest days in Siberia, I found to be
a hard-fisted soldier of the old school, who knows
his business and expects everybody in his command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to know it likewise, or give the reason why. He
knows the American soldier down to the ground, and
is the type of officer the enlisted man delights in&mdash;an
officer who realizes their difficulties on campaign,
talks to them as a father, and never allows any doubt
to arise as to who is boss.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, October 6, 1918, Colonel
Styer kindly sent word to me that Ataman Kalmikoff
was to conduct a ceremony incident to the organization
of a new regiment of Cossacks, and inviting
me to attend with the staff.</p>

<p>An orderly brought a horse for me at the appointed
time for departure, and as I mounted, I felt
the thrill that can only come to a man who, after a
lapse of thirteen years, again finds himself in an
American army saddle and an American army horse
between his knees.</p>

<p>We rode down through the gullys and over the
decrepit bridges, into the town, and dismounted in
front of the big Russian church on a cliff over the
Amur. Here we found a long line of Cossacks on
their horses, drawn up in single rank across the
street from the church, facing the little square.
There was a great throng of Siberians, keeping at a
respectful distance from the raised lances shining
above the heads of the shaggy ponies.</p>

<p>Here we were introduced to many Russian officers
in the service of Kalmikoff, nearly all of them
wearing orders of the Czar&#8217;s r&eacute;gime, and some of
them wearing orders gained on the Manchurian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
plains not so long ago, in action against the army of
Kuroki.</p>

<p>General Oi, the local Japanese commander, and
his staff arrived, and he and his officers were all
introduced to us. Among those there that day was
a lone British officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts.
I am not sure that this dignified and canny British
observer did not see more, and understand more, of
what was going on, than all the rest of us Anglo-Saxons.
This statement is not made in derogation
of the abilities of American officers as observers,
nor as a compliment intimating a superior craft in
international affairs on the part of the British officer,
but occurs to me as due to the lack of anything
approaching a &#8220;policy&#8221; regarding Siberian affairs
on the part of our administration.</p>

<p>Not knowing what we were expected to do beyond
avoiding as far as possible any action which might
be interpreted as &#8220;interference,&#8221; our interests did
not extend beyond the dramatic effect of what we
were there to witness. To us, it was merely a show,
possibly with something of an historical interest, as it
had been said that by presenting the colors to this
regiment of Cossacks, Kalmikoff was acting as a sort
of godfather at the &#8220;birth of the new Siberian
army.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the British, with India so close to Russia, and
an age-old suspicion of &#8220;the man who walks like
a bear&#8221; in the backs of their heads, watch Russian
affairs with deadly earnestness, for to lose India
might be the first break in the chain of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Empire. So to Colonel Roberts, a gaunt and elderly
officer typical of the men who have built the best
traditions of Britain in far-flung empires, this was
more than a mere entertainment of a day. At least
I got that impression, as I observed him&mdash;politely
punctilious, yet with roving eyes which saw, and
weighed, every trifling incident.</p>

<p>I felt that our attitude was the vaudevillian one
of &#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221; No doubt, if one of us had
written a detailed report of what happened that
day, and had dared to draw conclusions, and had
sent this report to, say, our own General Staff, it
might have been filed. But if we are going to deal
with international problems, we must begin to regard
foreign affairs seriously, and leave to the cartoonist
his humorous conceptions of foreign peoples.
We are somewhat inclined to regard humorously
the deadly earnestness of the British in dealing with
queer peoples, but the British know that queer
peoples are sometimes the most dangerous. We
persist in using them for comic opera material, and
then wonder why we cannot analyze promptly, and
take proper and decisive action to meet a crisis.</p>

<p>As we stood there in the morning sun, with the
wide river below, there was a sudden stir, and the
lances of the Cossacks became more rigid as the
troops came to attention.</p>

<p>From round the corner, we heard the clatter of
galloping hoofs, and suddenly, Kalmikoff swooped
into view, mounted on a superb black horse.</p>

<p>Rising in his stirrups, with saber upraised, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
cried in Russian, as he passed at full gallop, a hail
which was interpreted to me as: &#8220;Ussuri Cossacks!
Your commander comes!&#8221;</p>

<p>And from the line of horsemen, came the reply,
yelled in unison, &#8220;We are glad to greet you,&#8221; and
the lances, with their pennons, shot upward.</p>

<p>Kalmikoff whirled back, dismounted, and strode
into the church. A band blared the new Russian
anthem. From the church now came a column
of acolytes in white robes, some bearing crucifixes
before them, some swinging censors, all led by mitered
priests, who were intoning chants.</p>

<p>The band became silent, an altar was set up in
the square before the assembled troops, and a Russian
mass was said. Kalmikoff and his staff stood
at one side with bared and bowed heads, and on the
opposite side, General Oi, and his staff at attention.
In line with the Japanese, were Colonel Styer and
his staff. But General Oi, as fitting for the ranking
officer, stood a trifle to the front, in such position
that he was almost directly in front of me, and as he
bared his head, I was conscious of his shaven poll
gleaming between me and the altar. He is a short,
stocky, sturdy-looking man, with round, shaven face,
of most martial bearing, and bears himself with quiet
dignity.</p>

<p>Thrust up behind the altar was the gorgeously
colored and embroidered standard of the new regiment.
The priest, in chanting the mass, at times
removed his mitre, and his long black hair fell over
his shoulders, equalled only in length by his heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
beard. The choir nearby sang the responses, and
their voices were most sweet.</p>

<p>I watched Kalmikoff. A young man, said to have
been born in 1884, he is scarcely more than five feet
tall, slight of build, with bluish eyes, and a small
mustache. He wore a saber, and a small pistol
slipped into the loop of a strap hanging from his
belt, rather than a holster&mdash;a pistol so small as to
suggest a derringer. His aspect was proud and military,
but he did not make the figure one would expect
to see head of several provinces of Cossacks.
However, he is reputed to be very brave, a good
commander, and a dashing leader of irregular horse,
such as the Cossacks are. I heard that in the charge,
if any of his men attempted to ride ahead of him, he
promptly cut them down with his saber.</p>

<p>He had made himself a Major General, it was
said, and we understood that he was civil and military
governor of the Ussuri district. His claim to
the title of Ataman I never understood fully; some
said he was hereditary chief of all the Cossacks of
that section, and some said he had been elected to
that position by the Cossacks, while others maintained
that he had set himself up as the local prince,
with no more to back his authority than a small band
of partizans who were organized into a military
staff, chiefly engaged at that time in executing everybody
who opposed his rule.</p>

<p>Already, reports were coming down to our headquarters
that protests were being made by the
civilians of Khabarovsk, that many people were being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
executed by Kalmikoff&#8217;s orders without trial,
and that the victims were merely such personal enemies,
or such persons as might question Kalmikoff&#8217;s
authority.</p>

<p>But our position of &#8220;non-interference&#8221; with Russian
affairs, made it difficult for our staff to either
advise Colonel Styer, or for Colonel Styer to take
any action other than to make official inquiry of
Kalmikoff as to the executions. Not that I infer
Colonel Styer or our staff found it difficult to obey
orders, but Kalmikoff happened to be one of the
&#8220;Russian people,&#8221; and how could an American officer
interfere with Kalmikoff&#8217;s executions without
interfering with a Russian?</p>

<p>And at that time, Kalmikoff&#8217;s exploits in fighting
the Bolshevist forces were uppermost in the minds
of some of our officers, and it appeared that what
Kalmikoff did at that time was considered by some
subordinate officers to be indicative of his abilities
as a ruler. I heard one young officer say while I
was in Khabarovsk the first time: &#8220;The Ataman is
a smart fellow. He sits at his desk in headquarters,
and when a couple of prisoners are brought in, he
looks at them with those snapping little eyes of his,
and waving his hand, says: &#8216;take &#8217;em out and shoot
&#8217;em.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>That, to some minds, may be proof that a general
or a ruler is great; but I could not see that government
by firing squads by Kalmikoff is any better than
government by firing squads under the Czar. It all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
depends pretty much upon who is going to be shot,
and what the person is to be shot for.</p>

<p>If it happened to be a man of the city who privately
expressed an opinion that Kalmikoff had no
business executing peaceful citizens, who was to be
shot for expressing that opinion, the procedure as I
see it, is in line with Villa and similar bandits who
keep in the public eye by having the power and machinery
for wholesale human butchery.</p>

<p>The fact that a man may be brave, dashing, and
wear a picturesque hat, has nothing to do with a
judgment of his abilities or his morality. Government
by machine-gun may be necessary in certain
cases, but it means that the ruler who has to resort
to such tactics has oppressed the people, or has not
made proper use of the printing-press&mdash;in other
words, has not educated the people over whom he
rules, in the proper ideas.</p>

<p>I consider Kalmikoff a young upstart, not at all
concerned with what happened to Russia, but attempting
to take power to himself in a crisis, and
then aping the worst elements of the old r&eacute;gime.
And I believe that his interests were largely material,
and in such form that the gains financially
might easily be taken out of the country. Because
he had fought the Bolshevists, in no sense assured
me that he was at all what he posed as being&mdash;a Russian
patriot, working for the rehabilitation of a great
and united Russia. I may not have been alone in
this measure of the man, among the American officers,
and in speaking only for myself, I do not wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to imply that I was the only one to so gauge his
character.</p>

<p>To return to the ceremonies, when the mass in the
square was over, the priest blessed the colors of the
new regiment, and threw upon them holy water.
Then he presented them to Kalmikoff, who half knelt
to receive them, with a blessing. Standing, and
thrusting up the flag, he made a speech to his troops,
in which he said, among other things, that they were
always to guard it with their lives, as true Russians.</p>

<p>The color-bearer rode forward and took it from
the Ataman&#8217;s hands, and then the lances were
hoisted, and the Cossacks cheered both flag and Ataman.</p>

<p>After receiving the congratulations of the officers
assembled, Kalmikoff invited us to review his men
with him, and we mounted and rode down the street
to the position from which we were to review the
force.</p>

<p>As we rode along, we observed three Russians on
the sidewalk with their hands bound behind their
backs, being hustled along by Cossacks, and we
heard whispers that they were to be shot. But we
discreetly pretended not to see these prisoners, and
wheeled in our horses to let the new regiment pass.</p>

<p>The Cossacks approached in column of fours,
their new flag in the lead, and Kalmikoff took the
salutes of the commanders. The men of the First
Ussuri Regiment, as it was called, were a motley lot
but undoubtedly were good cavalry of the irregular
type. Their uniforms were a queer mixture of stuffs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and at times, it was hard to realize as some squads
passed, that this was really an army. It looked more
like a gathering of the clans from the hills and
plains, and most of them needed a haircut, as well as
a shave. But they looked proud and determined, and
able to over-awe any mob of civilians that might
gather to riot, or to do good work charging or raiding
an enemy of neater and more soldierly appearance.
Their arms showed good care, but their long-haired
Siberian ponies probably never had felt a
brush. Altogether, it looked like an army that had
been sleeping in its clothes for weeks, instead of a
regiment turned out in a capital city to get official
baptism.</p>

<p>In passing, I wish to state that a few months later,
these very troops mutinied against the severity of
Kalmikoff, and seeking protection from Colonel
Styer, were disarmed. I heard that the Japanese
commander demanded the arms, claiming them as
property of the Imperial Japanese Government. So
the lack of discipline so apparent on the day of the
&#8220;new Russian army&#8217;s&#8221; birth, rebounded upon the
commander, and indicates that on that day he held
his power by a very thin thread.</p>

<p>After the review we went to what was apparently
a hotel, judging from the sign, but which was reputed
to be Kalmikoff&#8217;s private residence. He had
probably borrowed it, after the style of Cossack
chiefs usurping power. We lunched there, while the
band played in an adjoining room. At the head of
the table sat Lieutenant General Oi, at his right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Colonel Styer. Kalmikoff&#8217;s officers, in the seating of
the guests, happened to put me beside Kalmikoff&#8217;s
chair, half way down the table from General Oi, the
seats between General Oi and Kalmikoff being occupied
by a Japanese colonel, and a Japanese staff
captain.</p>

<p>As it turned out, the lunch was in the nature of a
compliment to General Oi, and in due time Kalmikoff
made a speech in Russian, in which he thanked General
Oi for the aid the Japanese forces had rendered
him, making it possible to establish this regiment
just formed. Kalmikoff spoke no English. After
each sentence, an interpreter gave the translation in
Japanese, another interpreter gave us the English
of it.</p>

<p>General Oi responded likewise through an interpreter,
and as he spoke, gazed steadily at the opposite
wall, waiting patiently for his staff officers to
render his remarks into Russian and English. We
understood that he wished the new Russian army
success, and pledged the help of his forces in making
it a success.</p>

<p>There were considerable international politics
being let loose in that room. In effect, the Japanese
were backing Kalmikoff, and when we came to protest
against Kalmikoff&#8217;s actions, we were really protesting
what appeared to be actions advised by the
Japanese; at least, it is safe to draw the conclusion
that, owing General Oi what he asserted he did, Kalmikoff
was not running counter to General Oi&#8217;s
wishes. And I have heard it said that whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Colonel Styer asked Kalmikoff to explain the reasons
for executions, Kalmikoff went directly to General
Oi&#8217;s headquarters before making his reply to
Colonel Styer.</p>

<p>I do not bring these matters in as a criticism of the
Japanese. I cite heresay and such facts as I know,
to show that the Japanese were stronger politically
in their situation in that part of Siberia, than we
were. It may be safely assumed that General Oi was
acting according to instructions, and from that I
deduce that the Japanese government had a policy
of upholding all forces avowedly and surely anti-Bolshevists.
It may have been the correct policy.
At least, Kalmikoff knew that he could depend upon
the Japanese to back him up in putting down the Bolshevists.
He had no such assurance from our government.</p>

<p>It is human nature to lean to the side which declares
itself, and the Japanese made no secret of the
fact that they were backing Kalmikoff with arms and
money, and standing in the background while he consolidated
his power. This means that the Japanese
were really in control of things in the Ussuri, and
for wanting to hold that control, I do not blame
them, considering that they had large military
forces in the country, and were there as enemies to
the Bolshevists.</p>

<p>The Japanese took sides. This meant that at
least one side knew them as friends. In our case,
the anti-Bolshevist forces of the Russians, then chiefly
the Cossack forces, were confused by our attitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of grouping all Russian factions and classes together,
with what appeared to be a distinct leaning
to the Bolshevist side. The result was that real anti-Bolshevists
suspected our motives and were most
cautious in taking us into their confidence. But the
Japanese had the full confidence of the anti-Bolshevist
leaders, and to have the confidence of either
side in such times, gives a decided advantage in
getting a grasp of the situation.</p>

<p>I have no means of knowing the motives of the
Japanese in giving financial and military assistance
to the various Cossack chiefs. I have no particular
reason for assuming that their motives were anything
but what they claimed them to be&mdash;to put
down Bolshevism. I do doubt that the Japanese
motives were wholly to assist Russia in rehabilitating
itself as a great and powerful empire; I do doubt
that the Japanese Imperial government, sought or
seeks to see Russia a united and powerful republic.
Russia has been a source of worry to Japan for
many years, and the many barracks built in Siberia
since the Russo-Japanese war, have not had a tendency
to remove that worry. For if the war had not
broken in 1914, or if it had ended without smashing
the r&eacute;gime of the Czar, Japan would have felt the
weight once more of the Bear&#8217;s paw.</p>

<p>The bigger cities of Siberia are cities which have
grown up round new brick barracks. There are literally
miles of these barracks all through Siberia along
the railroad. These quarters could not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
necessary for an army of the size contemplated by
this construction, merely to keep order in Siberia.</p>

<p>It is plain enough that Russia contemplated revenge
for the Manchurian fiasco. The Czar undoubtedly
intended to throw a vast army into Siberia,
move it against Japan, throw another army into
Siberia behind in reserve, and keep hammering
Japan till the island Empire was destroyed or rendered
harmless in a military and naval way. He was
waiting for a new fleet capable of coping with Nippon&#8217;s
navy. And Japan knew it. I have doubts
that she wishes to see that menace once more in her
back yard, and under the present system of competition
between nations for territory, I do not blame
her for wishing to protect herself. Her methods are
another matter.</p>

<small>FROM KHABAROVSK TO USHUMUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A glance</span> at the map shows that a wedge of
Manchuria runs up into Siberia. Khabarovsk is at
the northern point. The Amur, flowing in a general
westerly direction, bending southerly along the
northern boundary of the Manchurian province of
Tsitsihar, and then turning to the north sharply as
it comes in contact with the province of Kirin, runs
up the westerly side of the wedge, and from Khabarovsk
flows almost due north, where it empties
into Amur Gulf, near the Siberian port of Nikolaievsk,
opposite the northern end of Saghalien Island.</p>

<p>The Amur branch of the trans-Siberian railroad
crosses the Amur River a little to the north of Khabarovsk,
and almost parallels the river, but at a considerable
distance to the north of it, crossing many
tributaries of the Amur flowing from the north.
The red line marking the railroad, superimposed on
a standard wall map, shows no railroad stations till
Kerak, some fifteen hundred versts west of Khabarovsk.
And the sectional Intelligence map which I
had, was little better, for the spelling of the towns
was so radically different, that except for the larger
places of simple spelling, I gave up using it except to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
orient myself by identifying the various small rivers.</p>

<p>Where the name of the town was transformed
into English by our Russian map-makers, and then
the station-sign in Russian betrayed no special affinity
for the Anglicized version, I found many
towns which were apparently astray. Like the navigator
who having made a landfall was told that the
port he was approaching was Karaka, said: &#8220;Impossible!
Karaka is two hundred miles to the south
of here on my chart!&#8221; when my interpreter told me
that we were arriving in Poperoffka, I looked at my
map and said: &#8220;Impossible! Unless the Bolshevists
have brought Poperoffka here and tied it till they
want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a company of the Twenty-seventh at
Ushumun, our farthest north. I had a limited time
in which to reach this company, and with one train a
day running, on uncertain schedule, I must needs
leave Khabarovsk to complete my itinerary in time.</p>

<p>But there was talk at Khabarovsk that this company
would draw down the line, though the time
of its departure was uncertain, and its destination
unknown. At headquarters of the Twenty-seventh
I could get no definite information, a fact which
puzzled me, until I learned that the movement was
to be directed by the Japanese commander, General
Otani, and that Colonel Styer, in command of the
regiment, was waiting for orders as to the movement.</p>

<p>I decided to proceed in accordance with my orders,
and from detachments of our troops seek news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
of the force supposed to be at Ushumun, and either
catch it, or go to where it was.</p>

<p>So with my interpreter, I embarked on a passenger
train, late at night. We got a &#8220;coup&eacute;&#8221; or
compartment, fitted with berths for four persons. It
was a so-called &#8220;sanitary car&#8221; of the second class,
and clean and comfortable. The car appeared to be
empty except for us, till morning, when we found a
Japanese captain and his orderly in the next compartment.</p>

<p>At Nikolsk, on the way to Khabarovsk, and at
Vladivostok, there were American officers in the
stations, members of the so-called Russian Railway
Service, known at home as the Stevens Commission.
All were expert railroad men, and telegraph operators,
and their presence in stations made travel
simple enough. But after leaving Khabarovsk, I
found the stations in charge of the regular Russian
staffs, and a Japanese staff, the latter with their own
telegraphic service. I had been under the impression
that every station had officers of our corps, and
as I found them missing over the Amur branch, I
was puzzled, in addition to being hampered for news
and a means of keeping in touch with my own headquarters.
At that time this corps was serving only
on the Chinese Eastern line, but I did not know it.</p>

<p>An instance of my helplessness may be shown
by the fact that the conductor of the train told my
interpreter that our car was going through to Ushumun,
and that we did not need to make any change
at Botchkereva, the junction point for the branch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
running south to Blagoveschensk. We arrived at
Botchkereva about daylight, and I hustled out to the
station, leaving my bedding and baggage in the car,
as we had been informed that we would have a stop
of an hour to wait for a train coming from the south.</p>

<p>I had so far received no information concerning
the expected movement of the force at Ushumun. I
now resolved to telegraph in Russian to Major Miller,
the commander, to learn of his plans. We translated
into Russian this message: &#8220;Please advise if
you will be at Ushumun to-morrow, as I am on my
way to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>My interpreter and the Russian telegraph operator
now engaged in a long debate, and as I was
about to inquire into the reasons for it, the interpreter
turned to me in consternation and told me
that we must get our baggage out of the car as
promptly as possible.</p>

<p>We fled down the tracks, and while the car was
already moving out, dumped through the window
without waiting to roll it, my bedding, grips, and
supplies of sugar and tea and other groceries, along
with the interpreter&#8217;s blankets and kit.</p>

<p>While we were thus distributing our property
along the railroad, the interpreter told me that the
car was going on the train to Blagoveschensk. He
also said that he had learned of this sudden shift
of the car by overhearing the Japanese commandant&#8217;s
interpreter at the station order the Russian
station-master to so switch the car, because the
Japanese captain in it desired to go to Blagoveschensk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
If that order had not been overheard, our
kits, so vitally necessary to us, would have been
whisked away, locked in the compartment. And our
conductor had assured us, by all the saints in the
Russian calendar, that the car was bound for Ushumun!</p>

<p>While we jettisoned our property from the car-window,
the Japanese captain and his orderly looked
on in mild surprise, probably sure that we were
wholly mad. In a sense we were. I refrain from
including our comprehensive and utterly complete
remarks on all things pertaining to the Russians,
from the time of the first Michael Romanoff up to
the present and into the future.</p>

<p>Having rolled up a fine supply of particularly
sharp cinders into my bedding-roll, and placed it
on the station platform, a Chinese took a liking to
it, and I discovered him making off with it. I doubt
if he understood English, but he did get the drift of
my remarks, for he dropped the roll.</p>

<p>Once more my interpreter resumed the debate
with the Russian operator, and the latter decided to
send my message. We had a wait of ten hours for
the next train, and I expected to hear from Major
Miller in time to know whether to proceed aboard
that train for Ushumun.</p>

<p>The station waiting-room, crowded with poor
people either waiting for trains, or simply killing
time and talking politics, was a most filthy place.
According to our standards, they were in dire poverty,
but men, women and children were most contented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and good-natured, and carried on their primitive
housekeeping on the floor, and the mothers performed
most intimate services for their children in
full view of the assemblage with a carelessness for
the senses of their neighbors which appalled me.</p>

<p>Yet no one seemed to mind. Barbaric-looking
Mongols, in fur boots and garments smelling of fish
and raw fur, came and sprawled at the long table,
and demanded tea and cabbage soup, which they disposed
of like wild animals come to the kill; great
hulking Russian peasants, their heads and faces half-hidden
in jungles of long, matted hair, sat crouched
on primitive stools, and ate the kernels of sunflower
seeds by the hour, throwing a handful of
the seeds into their mouths, chewing meditatively,
and then ejecting the seeds in a wide semi-circle before
them on the floor.</p>

<p>From the window I could see the rude troikas of
the farmers drive up, with three horses abreast.
They sat in their seats, while their women disembarked
from the rude carts, crawling out of the loose
straw upon which they had ridden, to unload bottles
of milk, cabbage, and potatoes.</p>

<p>While their lords stomped about the station,
drinking vodka in secret places, from which they
emerged wiping their mouths with the backs of their
hands, the women set up the farm products on boxes
near the station, and the market was open.</p>

<p>The mothers in the station crowds sought the milk
eagerly. Such milk, and in such bottles! The latter
had evidently never seen water, but were grimy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
with old and sticky milk down their sides. The wads
of paper and rudely whittled stoppers used as corks
were loose, and milk oozed up through them, to become
a feeding place for millions of flies.</p>

<p>In some cases the milk appeared to be sold by the
drink, a few kopecks giving a man or woman the
privilege of drinking from the bottle, while the seller
of the milk carefully watched the throat of the buyer
and counted the swallows. And I observed that the
last swallow taken, consisted of all the cheeks of the
buyer would hold.</p>

<p>I saw a bottle snatched from a man, who was attempting
to get more than his money&#8217;s worth.
Everybody laughed, including the bottle-snatcher,
and just to show that he was honest, and willing to
pay for his little joke, the man threw a few extra
postage-stamp kopecks to the woman, and went on
his way, his shoulders heaving with mirth over his
fun.</p>

<p>Those long hours of waiting at Botchkereva will
always stick in my memory as a period in my life
when I was reduced to peasantry in Siberia. It was
cold and drear enough to make the sugarless tea
from the steaming samovar taste like nectar; I acquired
a taste for greasy cabbage soup which revealed
formless chunks of meat concealed in its
foliage.</p>

<p>I shared with a giant Tartar my packet of Moscow
biscuits, and marvelled at the amount of nourishment
he could still pick from his teeth after he
had finished his meal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Lest I should build up the idea that travel de luxe
is all that I know, I wish to establish the fact that I
know the forecastles of fishing boats, have lived
below in cattle ships, and know intimately the foremast
life of tramp steamers. I have lived among
savages under most primitive conditions, and know
something of the hardships of campaign. I spent
eighty days &#8217;tween-decks in a transport from New
York to the Philippines by way of Suez in the days
when a soldier was a hard-bitted being and knew
nothing of Y. M. C. A. or Salvation Army aid.
Three times I have made the circuit of the globe,
bent on seeing and admiring and fighting, and have
always felt more or less at home wherever my campaign
hat happened to hang.</p>

<p>But in the Maritime Provinces of Siberia I got
the impression of being on a new planet. This place
seemed to me farther from civilization than any
place I had ever been, despite the fact that a railroad
passed the door of the station. The peasant of
Siberia can create and endure the vilest conditions of
life I have ever witnessed.</p>

<p>It is said that there are queer tribes to the north,
on the Siberian littoral, who are more hidden from
the world than the natives of Central Africa or the
Eskimos of the Arctic&mdash;the blacks of Africa and the
denizens of the regions near the poles have seen explorers
and traders, but civilization has never penetrated
portions of the mainland in behind Kamchatka.
This territory would no doubt prove to be
a rich field to the ethnologist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>I knew that the green minarets of a church not far
from the station marked the position of the town,
and I induced my orderly to take a walk. We
scouted for a bath-house, and found one. It was a
primitive structure of logs, floored with rotten adze-hewn
planks which were full of splinters, mouldy
and dangerously slippery. A girl of about twelve,
clad in dirty rags, conducted us into the place. It
looked as if it had been deserted for years.</p>

<p>A rude fireplace, built of rocks, held the stubs
of charred logs. Above, was a sort of stone oven
also made of rocks, but not mortared, so that there
were interstices through which a hand could be
thrust. It was into this oven-like place that water
was thrown, once the rocks were glowing from the
fire, and thus the steam was generated for the typical
bath.</p>

<p>Merely out of curiosity to see what would happen,
I gave the girl a ruble and asked her to prepare the
fire and bring water. Kissing the dirty slip of paper
money, she went out. In half an hour she had provided
one bucket of water and one stick of wood. In
time she had a sickly fire going. I judged that in
about six hours she would have the rocks of the oven
warm enough to turn water into steam.</p>

<p>We went wandering about the town, which consisted
of probably a couple of hundred crude buildings,
not counting the inevitable yellow buildings
near the station, provided for railroad employees.
The place seemed almost deserted, except for shivering
Chinese at their open-air counters in little kiosks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
at some of the street-corners. They were huddled in
these little huts, and were not at all eager to sell
their cigarettes and other goods&mdash;they most reluctantly
took their hands out of their ample sleeves,
which they used as muffs. I believe they were engaged
chiefly in selling vodka.</p>

<p>But for all the deserted-village aspect, the place
must have been well inhabited. Under the ornately
carved eaves of the buildings (which indicate long
and boresome evenings spent in whittling) there
were hanging long and deep fringes of brown
salmon, which had been split and hung up to dry.
These drying fish fill the village landscapes of Siberia
in the Fall months.</p>

<p>The human being who craves beauty in his surroundings,
even in the midst of desolation, is to be
commended. Yet when the barbarian carves the
house where he keeps his idol, or draws intricate designs
on his canoe, or tattoos his body, we say that
by these things he betrays his barbarism.</p>

<p>The Siberian can build a squat log house, and
with strips of wood cut into the most delicate filigree
work, make the ungainly structure dazzle your
eyes in a manner only to be rivalled by a silicate
Christmas card.</p>

<p>At home we still have houses which appear to be
the products of the jig-saw, and look more like wedding
cakes than places of residence. And all the
time in Siberian villages I was being reminded of
Yonkers and other suburban cities.</p>

<p>So I refrain from saying that the ornate eaves and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
window-trimming of Siberian homes prove the
Siberians to be barbarians. It might be better to say
that they outdo some of our own inhabitants when
it comes to being decoratively-minded.</p>

<p>Barbarism? We are all barbaric still, but we use
different methods of revealing it, and such things as
are familiar to us, we assert go to prove our civilization.
It is always the other fellow who is barbaric
when the psychologist goes hunting for stigmata. If,
for instance, I had found no decorations on Siberian
homes, I might have berated Siberians for neglecting
to beautify their surroundings. Those fretted eaves
are symbolical of the fact that the Siberian peasant
will aspire against all odds to better things, though
he may be crushed to earth generation after generation.</p>

<p>Yet if the time and energy represented by these
exterior decorations could have been expended on
their brains, the Siberians might have saved themselves
from many of their past, present and future
woes. Or if instead of satisfying the visual yearning
for beauty, the people protected their other senses
from the terrible and menacing smells which go with
their lack of sanitation, they might well do without
filigree work on their buildings. For if cleanliness
be next to godliness, the Siberian has a long and
hard road to travel before he approaches the
divinity.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we heard a train puffing
laboriously up the line, and hastened back to the
station. There was no reply to my telegram to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Major Miller. One of two things must be done&mdash;go
on, or give up. The telegraph operator informed
me that there was no answer from Ushumun. The
Japanese captain in charge of the station came to
tell me that if I were seeking Major Miller, that
officer was still at Ushumun, as his Japanese operators
had so informed him not an hour before.</p>

<p>The train arrived, and unloaded another throng
of unkempt natives. Those in the station clambered
aboard, fighting for places in the fourth-class cars,
already over-crowded in spite of the human freight
which had disembarked.</p>

<p>The usual scramble for hot water for tea-kettles
took place; men bought double handfuls of red
salmon-eggs, big as peas, and giving off an odour
similar to a glue factory. Caviare? No, they have
never heard of caviare. Eekrah, they call this vile
mess.</p>

<p>The milk market did a lively business, while the
engine loaded wood, in the leisurely manner with
which all such work is done. The train crew abandoned
the train, and made an onslaught on the cabbage
soup and tea&mdash;and talk! such a flood of talk
they produced with the Russian staff of the station!</p>

<p>With my baggage stowed in a crowded fourth-class
car, holding some forty persons each determined
to keep inviolate the few inches of seating
space already pre-empted, I got into the open air
again, and attracted by the clamor of the railroad men
in the station, I got my interpreter to translate
some of the conversation, which, by the vigor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
shown by the talkers, must indicate something afoot
which would stand out in Russian history. Perhaps
a new revolution, or the Czar had come back to the
throne.</p>

<p>This was the burden of their excited discussion:</p>

<p>The engine is bad.</p>

<p>When will these accursed Japanese go away?</p>

<p>The weather is good.</p>

<p>I am very thirsty.</p>

<p>I have a lazy Chinese for a helper.</p>

<p>Ivan, who worked at Nikolsk, is sick.</p>

<p>Do you remember when Peter fell in the river?</p>

<p>The tea is good.</p>

<p>I will see my wife when I go back to First River.</p>

<p>My mother&#8217;s mother had a boil ten years ago&mdash;she
cured it with ashes.</p>

<p>What time is it? Never mind, what does it
matter?</p>

<p>My brother&#8217;s cow has a calf.</p>

<p>And the world shuddering about what would happen
to the Russian people, groping amid the ruins of
a shattered nation! Massacres in Petrograd and
Moscow, in Samara and Perm, Vladivostok in control
of Allied troops, wreck and ruin, refugees and
desolation, unlimited numbers of factions quarreling
to see who would pick the bones of the country,
intrigue, murder and sudden death stalking through
city and town, the very railroad on which they
worked ready to lie down and die in its tracks, their
wages six months overdue, and no telling what would
happen to-morrow to themselves or their families&mdash;these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
people calmly discussed the birth of a relative&#8217;s
calf!</p>

<p>And I, with several thousand other American citizens,
had cast aside all the things we held dear, to
come half way round the world and fight to save
Russia! The American people poured men and
money, to help these people, and for a long time will
be paying the bills. But the Russian worried only
about the temperature of his tea, and wondered why
we should worry at all about him or his affairs. And
the railroad men in Siberia represent the best type of
working men, far above the simple peasant in mental
advancement.</p>

<p>With a similar state of affairs at home, can we
imagine the crew of one of our passenger trains finding
nothing to discuss but trivial personal affairs?
Yet we persisted in considering the Russian people
on a par with our own in seeking enlightened government
and an orderly condition of life, once they
had rid themselves of the oppressing Czar and his
bureaucrats.</p>

<p>In due time, our train moved out. The car windows
were sealed tightly against any outside air.
The three decks of sleeping shelves were filled with
men, women and children, so completely that from
floor to ceiling there was a solid block of humanity.
I managed to secure a shelf for my blankets, by
watching those who prepared to detrain at stations
ahead, and taking the space before the new passengers
got in.</p>

<p>The narrow aisle was so piled with cases and bags<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
of merchandise and personal effects, that it was almost
impossible to get in or out of the car. And
there were battles royal at every station, as one mob
tried to get out while the other mob fought its way
inside. There were many Chinese, peddling with
packs, carrying salt, tea, sugar and such necessities,
and selling them at exorbitant prices. Instead of
sugar, there was also a cheap, highly-colored candy,
used to sweeten tea&mdash;and give it most outlandish
flavors.</p>

<p>These speculating Chinese were most rude and insolent
to the Siberians. I saw a pair of them drive
a woman and her two children from a seat, and
leave them standing, in order to get the seat for
themselves. A young Cossack officer hove them out
bodily, but they ran after the train and rescued their
baggage. They who had been so overbearing with a
helpless woman, gave a fine exhibition of cringing
when they in turn found themselves in the presence
of a strong and ruthless personality.</p>

<p>The provodnik distributed candles as darkness
came on, and we rattled along through the night at
about ten miles an hour, slowing down discreetly to
cross temporary bridges, which had been built where
the Bolshevists, as they fled before the Allies, had
blown out the original structures.</p>

<p>The candles increased the richness of our air-mixture,
and as they burned low and guttered smoking
tallow over bare feet of sleepers, the odor of
the salmon-roe, cached in tin cans about the car, almost
lost its lusty pervasiveness. I awoke at about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
midnight, and though the candles were still glimmering
faintly and producing a nut-flavored smoke, the
salmon-roe still held its own, and asserted its presence
unmistakably.</p>

<p>The cause of my waking was a burly Chinese, who
mistaking me for a peasant as I lay on my shelf
rolled in my blankets, took the liberty of heaving
several of his heavy boxes in upon me, in an attempt
to discourage me from occupying so much space.
My reading of Darwin made me realize that it was
a case of the survival of the fittest. I felt particularly
fit, and when that Chinese had eliminated himself
from the car, along with his baggage, I went
back to sleep. I forgot in the meantime the necessity
for maintaining cordial international relations with
China, and made it a purely personal matter.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it must be the boldest spirits among
the Chinese who dared travel in that part of Siberia
with anything of value. I was awakened later that
night by a great to-do in the car, when Cossacks at
a station went through the train and looked all the
passengers over, including baggage. They took two
Chinese out of the car, with some bulky bundles.
The bundles proved to be full of packets of paper
rubles. The Cossacks debated among themselves as
to whether so much wealth was not in itself evidence
of criminality, and favored confiscating the money.
How much was given up, I do not know, but once
more the Chinese came back, settled themselves for
sleep upon their shelf and we rolled merrily on.</p>

<p>Toward morning I was awakened once more by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
big peasant who stepped upon my face, in order to
climb to the top of the car. I watched him mount
upward, till he was in reach of a ventilator, and I
came to the conclusion that I had misjudged peasants
when it came to desiring fresh air&mdash;it was obvious
that this man desired to tamper with the ventilator
in the ceiling so that it would provide a better
opening to let out our bad odors.</p>

<p>But instead, before my horrified eyes, he closed it!
And not satisfied with its natural tightness, he stuffed
into it a Russian newspaper in which had been
wrapped salmon-eggs! I roused myself, dressed,
and went out on the car-platform in the crisp, cool
air where I waited for the sun to rise over the bleak
hills.</p>

<p>Before long, we came to a small yellow depot,
with this signboard upon it, as near as I can reproduce
with Roman letters: &#8220;YXXYMYH&#8221;&mdash;it was
Ooshoomoon, or Ushumun, the y&#8217;s distributed
through its system providing the oo sounds in Russian.</p>

<p>Not an American soldier in sight. We learned
from the telegraph operator that Major Miller and
his force had left the evening before in a troop-train,
and had passed us during the night, going in the
direction from which we came.</p>

<p>As for my telegram to Major Miller, the operators
had never heard of it. I suppose the operator
at Botchkereva had pocketed my rubles, and let it
go at that. Anyhow, that is the most brilliant procedure
I can ascribe to him. He was either a fool<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
or a knave. With the people then operating the
trans-Siberian railroad, the theory that they mask
their knavery under stupidity has proven true with
me, in the long run. By appearing stupid, and so
making fools of the smart Americanskys, they prove
their superiority to us, according to their Asiatic
style of reasoning. They would rather pocket our
money than to show to us something in the nature
of human intelligence.</p>

<p>But my missing Major Miller was not vital, except
in so far as I was concerned with the element
of time. We got our baggage out of the car, and
faced the prospect of spending the night and most
of the next day in the primitive little station, waiting
for the single train running daily, which would take
us back toward Khabarovsk.</p>

<small>ON THE BACK TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> train which had brought us to Ushumun
pulled out to the east, leaving me sitting on my bedding-roll
smoking a cigarette in the frosty morning,
while my interpreter went to the station restaurant
to ask if they had any eggs, and if they had, would
they please fry them &#8220;sunny side up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Physically and mentally, inside and out, I was flat.
My love for Siberia and the Siberians was at its lowest
ebb&mdash;I would have sold the whole country to the
Cossacks at a bargain price, if I had owned it that
morning. I yearned for the trenches&mdash;any place,
where if a man displayed a copious vocabulary, its
full depth of feeling and expression might be appreciated.</p>

<p>A Japanese civilian, in a bluish sort of suit, which
reminded me of chauffeurs in New York who buy
cast-off livery to wear as a uniform, drew near, and,
so to speak, wagged his tail. (Later I learned that
his outward aspect was similar to that of Japanese
officers on secret service).</p>

<p>He spoke fairly good English, but managed to
maintain an abject and apologetic manner. He informed
me that he had been a barber in Vladivostok,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the purpose of which remark I could not fathom&mdash;either
he was attracted by the glamor of a two-day
beard of reddish hue which I wore, or he mentioned
Vladivostok to account for his having learned English.
His progress in the language must have been
rapid if he learned English there from the American
troops, for up to about a month before, one might
have as well gone to Timbuctu to acquire our
language.</p>

<p>He squatted on his heels before me, and asked
for a match. He being the most amiable object on
the landscape, I did not resent his presence, but gave
him the match, and he lit a limp cigarette with great
solemnity. I could fairly hear him think of how to
attack me as a problem and wring from me the most
possible information.</p>

<p>Finally, after considerable discussion of the most
commonplace weather, he got down to business. I
must say that if he revealed the teachings of the
Japanese military secret service, that organization is
far behind the times. It was counter-espionage at
its worst.</p>

<p>He wanted to know first where I was going. I
told him that I intended to stay permanently in those
parts, which put him in something resembling a
panic. He recovered in time to ask me what part
of town I intended to reside in. As I could see no
town, I told him I intended to live in the railway
station. He nearly fell off his heels, so overcome
was he&mdash;for which I do not blame him, considering
the station.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>He assured me dismally that there was a Japanese
officer, and several Japanese soldiers, already living
in the station, and that there was not room left for
so much as a flea&#8217;s brother-in-law. I told him that
my orders were to live in that section, and I intended
to do so if I had to sleep on the counter
where the samovar stood in the daytime.</p>

<p>Now orders to a Japanese soldier, are not merely
orders as we understand them&mdash;they are sacred revelations
emanating from the most holy place in
Japan and the heavens above. He understood that I
was going to live in that station, even if I had to
pitch out a whole Japanese division. He almost wept
over the prospect, but borrowing one of my cigarettes,
which I had most carelessly exposed, he got
off his heels, and departed sadly to that part of the
station where the Japanese officer in charge cooked
his rice.</p>

<p>Presently the &#8220;barber&#8221; was back, now with a Japanese
captain, who approached me as if I were a
divinity. I let him approach close before I &#8220;saw&#8221;
him, and then leaped to my feet and came to a most
dramatic salute. He beamed upon me, and after we
had got done bowing and scraping, the barber announced
proudly that the Japanese officer had come
to pay his respect to the American officer. I
acknowledged his kindness with a bow that near
broke my car-stiffened back.</p>

<p>The barber, who refrained now from sitting on
his heels, and betrayed a most suspicious desire to
look military, said that he would be glad to interpret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
for us, and said that the Japanese captain was most
sad over my fate&mdash;I must have the steel of Samurai
in my backbone to face so calmly an existence which
would undoubtedly wreck my constitution, if it did
not result in my death. I replied that I was a soldier,
and was tempted to say that so far as I could observe,
the Japanese captain was bearing up most
wonderfully under a similar mode of life. But one
must be extremely careful in joking with Japanese.</p>

<p>But I knew that in order to save my face when
I took the first train bound south, I had better not
carry my simulation of a desire for permanent residence,
too far. So I became disconsolate, as they
went on to tell of the discomforts awaiting me.</p>

<p>The Japanese captain took me to the little shed
adjoining the station, where he lived. He had improvised
a shelf a few inches from the dirt floor,
and with a fire in a bucket, called it home. He gave
me saki, in a thimble-like glass, and some raw fish.
And he smiled and smiled as I said I could never
endure such quarters. No doubt he has made a report,
in which he cites the fact that American officers
will not willingly endure privations on campaign.
Thus do the nations get false ideas about
one another.</p>

<p>I expressed a desire to get out of Ushumun as
quickly as possible. The Japanese captain beamed.
He informed me that a Japanese troop-train was
coming down the line, and would pass through there
in a couple of hours. If I desired to travel away on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
it, he could probably arrange with the train commander
for transportation. Which he did.</p>

<p>So when a train with a Japanese battery of artillery
arrived, I saw my friend in serious consultation
with the train commander, and I was invited to the
fourth-class coach on the rear, filled with officers and
soldiers, and given a section, the soldiers being put
out in box-cars with the horses and other men.</p>

<p>I do not care to analyze the motives which led the
Japanese captain to hurry me out of Ushumun. It
was obvious that he desired me far away. And my
expressed intention of staying there, only increased
his worry. If I had told him I intended leaving by
the next train, no doubt I would have spent that
day and the next night in discomfort in Ushumun
station. But it is not in me to look a gift-horse in
the mouth.</p>

<p>The section in the car assigned to me and my soldier-interpreter
provided wooden shelves for six
persons, the upper ones so arranged that they could
be folded up out of the way. I begged the train commander
to put four of the six non-commissioned
officers who had been ousted for my benefit, back in
their quarters, but he replied through his interpreter,
and with profound bows, that the entire section was
mine. And the hospitality accorded me in that car
will never be forgotten. On that trip I came nearer
to being royal than I ever expect to be again.</p>

<p>Knowing something of the administration of a
battery of light artillery, I was most interested in
seeing how horses and men were cared for by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Japanese. They attended to their duties as if work
were sacred rites. They messed their men, fed and
watered their horses, not merely well, but as if the
fate of the Japanese Empire depended upon the
utmost efficiency of every cog in that particular
machine.</p>

<p>The simplicity of their messing arrangements for
the men, in comparison with our own army in trains,
is remarkable. We have to provide kitchen-cars,
fitted up with field ranges, meat, bread, potatoes,
canned tomatoes, coffee, and provide buckets of hot
water for washing mess-kits. It is like a primitive
travelling hotel, and our men go to the car to have
their meals dealt out by the cooks. And on the
trans-Siberian line, the road-bed was so rough, and
the cars so light and the wheels so flattened by bad
usage, it was frequently impossible to boil water
over our stoves while under way. This necessitated
stops en route to prepare meals and serve them, and
once a train has lost its right of way by stopping in
a siding, it may mean hours before the line ahead is
clear of regular traffic, so that the troop-train may
go on.</p>

<p>The mess-kit of the Japanese soldier is a metal
container, about the size and shape of a case for
large field-glasses. The top clamps on so that it is
water-tight. A handful of dry rice, a little water, a
fire by the track, and the mess-kits are thrown into
the blaze.</p>

<p>In a short time, the soldier&#8217;s meal is ready, and
after he has eaten as much as he wants, the remainder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
is kept hot by closing the lid. I have seen Japanese
prepare their meals during a ten-minute stop
by such methods. And each soldier, on the march,
can carry enough dry, light rice, to last him several
days. His columns are not hampered by the slow
progress of heavy ration-wagons, his food is not in
danger of being cut off by enemy, his service of supply
presents no problem. The swift movements of
the Japanese armies during the Russo-Japanese war
were due to the simplicity of their transport.</p>

<p>On this trip I came to a full realization of the
hatred held for the Japanese by the Siberian populace.
It is hatred remaining as a result of the Russo-Japanese
war; it is a hatred engendered by fear of
the Japanese, and their ambitions regarding the
future of Siberia; it is a hatred deeply-embedded in
the hearts of the Russians, and of such intensity that
the two races cannot hope ever to mingle with any
amity.</p>

<p>I found it embarrassing, too; to stop in a station,
and be recognized as an &#8220;Americansky&#8221; and receive
the smiles and open admiration of the people, while
my hosts were covertly, and sometimes openly,
sneered at, and disrespectful and insulting remarks
about &#8220;monkey-faces&#8221; came out of groups of peasants,
made it apparent to my hosts that I was much
in favor with the people, and that the Japanese were
regarded as if they were rattle-snakes. It must have
hurt the sensitive pride of the Japanese, but I must
give them credit for good discipline, and splendid
self-control, in the face of such treatment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Had I not been present, it is likely that the Russians
would have been more cautious; as it was, my
presence only subjected the Japanese to insults which
they might not have had to endure in the presence of
a witness. But they went on about their business, as
if their superiority to the Siberians was something
which was beyond question&mdash;and perhaps their attitude
held something of a &#8220;biding my time,&#8221; for a
suitable revenge.</p>

<p>Standing outside the car one afternoon, beside the
Japanese troop-train commander, I saw a Japanese
soldier coming toward the train with two large
buckets, a Siberian peasant following him closely,
and calling out in protest. The soldier, aware of the
fact that he was under the eyes of his commander,
made no reply, but came on. Presently, as the Siberian
came close enough to recognize me as an American,
he darted up behind the soldier, and pulled
from one of the buckets, a head of cabbage. The
train commander looked on, but made no comment,
though it was obvious that the Japanese soldier was
stealing the cabbage. Under similar circumstances,
an American soldier would have been reprimanded
on the spot.</p>

<p>The Siberian put the cabbage on the ground, and
emboldened by the passive attitude of the Japanese,
once more ran in pursuit, and extracted from the
other bucket, another cabbage. Having emptied the
buckets of the forager, he departed with his cabbages.
I wondered if he would have been allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
regain his property if I had not been with the
Japanese.</p>

<p>In this connection, peasants always came to my
interpreter with complaints against the Japanese.
But our orders were to give no heed to such complaints&mdash;in
fact, not to listen to them. There were
tales of murder, robbery, outrage, of isolated districts
in which Japanese soldiers drove the people
from their homes, and took the dwellings as quarters,
confiscating all money and property in possession
of the people. I can only cite the fact that these
stories were told; the truth of them is a matter I am
not competent to discuss.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we were back in Botchkereva,
and stopped there while the horses were fed
and watered. I went to the station restaurant for
tea. There I found a young lieutenant of the
Twenty-seventh Infantry, who had left Khabarovsk
two days later than I did, in an effort to find Major
Miller&#8217;s force.</p>

<p>His name was <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and he was shivering from
the cold, for it was not time to begin the sale of tea
and food, though the girls were sleepily washing the
floors, and firing up the samovars. A throng of refugees
were standing about, patiently waiting for the
hour to arrive when they might get something hot.</p>

<p>My interpreter and I were thoroughly chilled, but
no amount of money would induce the slatternly
girls to give us even hot water from the samovars&mdash;it
lacked a half an hour before they would begin to
serve anything. I looked at the men, women and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
children huddled together in corners, some of them
shivering so violently that their teeth chattered, and
poor, under-nourished and illy-clad children crying
from cold. Why the attendants must observe such
regular hours, under such conditions, I could not understand,
and never will. It may be that it was a
demonstration of the &#8220;rosy conditions of Soviet Russia,&#8221;
which an American referred to recently in a
speech at Madison Square Garden, New York, at
which the beauties of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime were extolled.
But I wish to call attention to the fact that
those who did the extolling of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime
were not enjoying that r&eacute;gime in Russia&mdash;they were
enduring the hardships of the &#8220;capitalistic United
States.&#8221;</p>

<p>The solution of the mystery as to why shivering
and hungry people in that station could not buy tea
from bubbling samovars till the clock struck a certain
hour, probably lies in the fact that the attendants
were &#8220;free,&#8221; and members of a Soviet. When
it comes to autocracy, the peasant of Russia can outdo
all autocrats. And curiously enough, they are
most cruel to their own kind. If a pair of Cossack
officers had come into that station, and demanded
tea forthwith, I believe they would have had it, regardless
of the time. The fact that the samovars
were steaming would have been reason enough for
serving the tea.</p>

<p>More out of curiosity than necessity, I made every
plea to get tea; my train would go on shortly; I
would give fifty rubles for three glasses of tea; I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
ill; I must have tea then, or go without it all day.
None of these arguments got the tea.</p>

<p>So having a supply of dry tea of my own, my
interpreter took the cups from our canteens, and
putting them over the little fires of the Japanese soldiers
alongside the track, brewed our own warming
beverage for breakfast, and invited <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> to
join us.</p>

<p>Once he had driven the chills from his body, he
told me that he had sat up in the station all night,
only pretending to nap, because he had a suitcase full
of rubles to pay off the men of Major Miller&#8217;s force
and was afraid it might be stolen. And in order to
divert suspicion from the suitcase, he had thrown it
carelessly in a nearby corner, as if it did not matter
what became of it, though he kept a wary eye
upon it.</p>

<p>He said it was likely that the train to take him
back to Khabarovsk might not arrive till that night.
I immediately asked the commander of the train if
I might take <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> with me, and he gladly assented.
So when the train moved out, <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> shared a lower
shelf with me.</p>

<small>A RED SWEATER AND THE GENERAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened that I wanted to get off at a little
station, called Bira. And I understood that the Japanese
troop-train would stop there to feed and
water, making a sufficient stop for me to visit the
company of American soldiers quartered in box-cars
on a siding. But we whisked through Bira at an
early hour, and we were well down the line toward
Khabarovsk, before I learned of the change of plans
of the train commander.</p>

<p>But I planned to leave the train the next morning,
and double back, visiting our detachments on the
way. Besides, I wished to locate a certain English-speaking
Russian, who wore a red sweater and made
it his business to work or loaf wherever we had soldiers
and to mingle with them to strike up acquaintances.
This man had worked several years in the
United States, and he was busy at his special propaganda
among our troops.</p>

<p>It was not so much his work and spying which I
wished to investigate, but I was interested in his
methods, and I wished to determine if possible who
was supplying him with money and who was directing
his efforts. He was not merely a man who professed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
a dislike for the United States, but he evidently
belonged to a coterie which was well instructed
as to how to build up an enmity between the Russians
and the Americans.</p>

<p>I had talked with this man twice, or rather he
had sought me out and tested my knowledge on what
the United States intended to do in Russia. I had
discussed matters with him as if he were what he
pretended to be&mdash;an uneducated working man. As
a matter of fact he had been a lawyer in Michigan,
making a poor living among Russian and other immigrants,
and none too ethical in his ways of making
money.</p>

<p>Such detachment commanders as I had talked
with on the way up, when asked as to suspicious
characters, all declared that they had noticed no
persons who appeared to be worthy of attention&mdash;and
all told me of Red Sweater. The usual story
about him was about this:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man in a red sweater who worked
here on the track a few days, with the section hands.
He talks English. He hung around our men, generally
showing up at mess-time, and asking for some
American food. He has &#8216;joshed&#8217; the men about being
in this country, but they don&#8217;t pay any attention
to him. He finally went away, and we haven&#8217;t seen
him for a couple of weeks. But he doesn&#8217;t amount
to anything&mdash;just kind of a poor simpleton, who
thinks he knows it all because he can talk a little
English.&#8221;</p>

<p>That sounded reasonable enough the first time I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
heard it. The next time I heard it, I began to take
notice, and a day or so later, Red Sweater attached
himself to my train in the capacity of a provodnik, a
man who keeps up the fires, pretends to sweep the
car, and gives out the candles.</p>

<p>Red Sweater worked first on my interpreter, and
then felt his way along with me in English. At that
time, I was confident that our expedition would take
such action as was necessary for the good of Russia,
and in time proceed to establish a new Russian front
against Germany in association with all the available
forces of our Allies. Of course, this was some
time before the armistice, or early in October. But
I professed to be entirely out of sympathy with any
American action in Russia. That attitude was far
more likely to bring to my attention such Russians,
or enemy agents, as secretly opposed us, than an attitude
of desiring aggressive action by my country.
And in their eagerness to find an American who upheld
their contention, Bolshevist agents and others,
walked into the little trap and revealed their lines of
propaganda. It is remarkable how the person who
appears to be a malcontent, attracts the professional
agitators&mdash;they seem overjoyed at the prospect of
making a convert, or in having their reasoning and
actions justified by others not in their circle.</p>

<p>And Red Sweater was dangerous, not because of
the falsity of the things he said, but on account of the
truths he uttered, and his subtlety in perverting truth
to fit his ideas and theories. It was probably such
chaps, working among our troops in Archangel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
which caused the reported &#8220;mutiny&#8221; in our forces
there&mdash;just &#8220;kind of a poor simpleton,&#8221; saying silly
things, and not worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Red Sweater was clever in his ways. He made no
statements on his own responsibility, but always
quoted the &#8220;Russian people.&#8221; As I listened to his
arguments, I was led to believe that he must have
held a plebecite which included every inhabitant of
Siberia and European Russia, and to him alone, had
been revealed the desires and intentions of two hundred
million inhabitants.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Russian people do not trust the United
States,&#8221; he said glibly, after he was assured that I
was &#8220;safe.&#8221; &#8220;You are a capitalistic nation, and they
know it. You say you are friends of the Russian
people but the Russian people ask: &#8216;Why are you
fighting Russian people near Archangel if you are
our friends?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not fighting the Russian people here.
They ask why not? And their answer is: &#8216;The capitalists
of the United States do not fight us here, because
they wish to steal our trans-Siberian railroad.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Russian people say they have freed themselves
of capitalists. The United States say they are
free people&mdash;but the capitalists of the United States
have conscripted the &#8216;free&#8217; working men of the
United States, and compelled them to come here to
Russia to fight the free Russian working men. That
is what the Russian people say. You think you are
serving your country by being here. The Russian
people say you are serving your capitalists, to again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
enslave the Russian working men. The Russian people
say they have a right to run their own country
in their own way, but the capitalists of the United
States send an army of conscripts over here to prevent
the Russian people from keeping their freedom.
If the working men of the United States were satisfied
with their country, would they want a Russian
army to go over there, and tell them how to run it?
But the Russian people know that the people of the
United States did not send this conscript army over
here&mdash;the capitalists did that. And for that reason
the Russian people do not want to fight you&mdash;they
do not want you to fight them. Japan and England
do not want a republic here&mdash;they want to put the
Czar back. Both those countries have thrones, and
their rulers do not want to see new republics. And
the reason they want to see the Czar back here, is
that they can make secret treaties with the Czar,
but they could not make secret treaties if we had a
government of the people. The Russian people say
the American capitalists sent an army here to help
Japan and England put the Czar back on his throne.
If he is put back on the throne, and partly by your
help, are you sure that the Czar, the Emperor of
Japan, and the King of England, will not combine,
and some day send their armies to force the people
of the United States into having an Emperor? The
Russian people say to you: &#8216;Comrades, we understand.
You, too, must overthrow your capitalists, as
we have done, and control your own country for the
benefit of the working men.&#8217; The Russian people say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
you are not free yet&mdash;no man is free, if he can be
conscripted for the benefit of capitalists, and sent to
the other side of the world to fight the working men
of another country.&#8221;</p>

<p>And some officers thought Red Sweater did not
&#8220;amount to anything.&#8221; This was because they had
no way of knowing that his itinerary included every
station where American troops might be found, and
because he was clever enough to look like a poor
tramp, and wise enough to act the fool when the
occasion demanded that he conceal his purposes.</p>

<p>He deserted my train after he had traveled far
enough to plant his insidious propaganda in my
mind. The next time I saw him, he did his best to
get me to ask the Japanese troop-train commander
to let him ride with us. I did no such thing, whereupon
he concealed himself between the cars, and I
was now interested to see at what point he would
leave us. This was one of the reasons I was willing
enough to pass through Bira.</p>

<p>The night following our passage through Bira, I
got to sleep about ten o&#8217;clock. At a quarter to eleven
I woke with a start, for no apparent reason. <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;</span>
was sleeping soundly beside me, and my interpreter
was snoring on an upper shelf. The train was toiling
up hills slowly, and then dashing down the other
side recklessly, or so it seemed to me. Many bridges
had been blown out by the Bolshevists, and small
rivers and gullies were crossed by the railroad over
temporary trackage, laid on amazing grades, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
poorly ballasted, for the purpose of making detours
around the wrecked bridges.</p>

<p>I felt the train making painful progress up a
slope. The engine puffed laboriously. We reached
the crest of the hill, and suddenly began to go down
at a rapidly increasing rate, and at the same time I
missed the noise of the engine, some thirty or forty
cars ahead. Our car was the last on the train.</p>

<p>There was a terrific crash, far ahead, and then
every moveable thing on our car started for the
front end. My interpreter was hurled off his shelf
amid all the cooking utensils and food in the car,
<span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;</span> was slammed up against the side of the section,
and I skidded on my elbows out on the floor,
barely avoiding taking an iron support which held
the shelf above me, off with my head.</p>

<p>The car swung round sidewise and lurched downward,
and amid the sound of rending timbers, appeared
to be headed for a river below. I was sure
we had gone through a blown-out bridge.</p>

<p>But the derailed car settled over gently on its
side, and came to rest. We got out as quickly as
possible, not sure that the wrecked train was safe
from attack by Bolshevists. Under a cold, clear
sky, we saw that the train had been shattered in the
center, the wreck occurring on a sharp down grade
between the banks of a cut. Several of the small and
light box-cars, containing horses and Japanese soldiers,
had been smashed, but the damage was not
great, due to the fact that the shock had been absorbed
by the cars bulging upward into an inverted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
V. The Japanese were busily engaged in getting out
horses, and in checking up their men, to ascertain if
any had been killed. There were a few minor
injuries.</p>

<p>It was too cold to linger outside long in my
pajamas, and I went back to the car, and finding our
electric flashlights, sorted ourselves out and went
back to sleep. In the morning we learned just what
had happened.</p>

<p>The train had broken open in the middle at the
crest of the hill. The engine, with the forward half,
had run down into the valley over temporary trackage.
Then the engineer discovered what had happened.
The tail end of his train was just gaining
headway over the crest, and coming down with increasing
speed. So, in order to go back and get it,
he reversed his engine and came back at top speed,
meeting us in the cut when we had acquired good
speed from the descending grade. It was a splendid
example of how not to recapture the runaway half
of a troop-train.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_100b"><img src="images/i_100b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">JAPANESE OFFICERS TALKING WITH AN<br /> AMERICAN OFFICER</p>

<p>That is an impartial description of what happened.
But there was every reason to believe that
the engineer, working with a confederate aboard the
train, knew the train would be split at the proper
place to allow the engine to get away, and then
come back with the most disastrous results. And I
believe that Red Sweater split the train, for when a
wrecking train came the next morning to clear the
tracks, the engine of our train and such cars as
would travel, going ahead to the next station to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
allow the wreckers to get in at the smashed cars, Red
Sweater rode away with the first load of battered
cars pulled out.</p>



<p>During that day, and the best part of that night,
the Russian wrecking crew worked and talked and
drank tea, on a job that would have taken an American
wrecking crew, two hours. Before a pair of
broken trucks could be ditched, there must be a discussion
which suggested the Duma in action against
the Czar. But the Japanese, stoical and silent, were
not fooled&mdash;they recognized as fine a piece of sabotage
as had ever been produced.</p>

<p>When we resumed our journey, we three were
nearly famished for want of food. We had brewed
tea, and consumed a string-load of pretzels, and as
the Japanese had not noticed that we were short of
supplies, we had refrained from asking for any of
their food.</p>

<p>Train schedules were so upset, that I figured I
might as well go on to Khabarovsk, and get the next
train out again to Bira. In the meantime I might
pick up the trail of Red Sweater among the railway
detachments strung along the line.</p>

<p>So we made a long stop at a station called Poperoffka,
some fifteen versts from Khabarovsk. There
was a platoon of Americans there, commanded by a
lieutenant, quartered in box-cars. <span class="nobr">D&mdash;&mdash;,</span> my interpreter
and myself lost no time in getting to the
kitchen-car, where we bought canned tomatoes, potatoes,
bread and coffee, and bribed the cook to prepare
a meal.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>There we learned that the Commanding General
had passed through, bound north in a private car,
with a private engine. And just as I had attacked a
mess-kit full of corned beef, my first square meal in
a week, soldiers came to inform the lieutenant in
command, that the Commanding General was returning,
and that he was leaving his private car with
his staff.</p>

<p>General Graves was making a tour of inspection.
He visited our kitchen-car, with a dozen or more
officers. He was puzzled because he had just visited
a station where the commanding officer had not
heard of my presence in that part of the country.
He was very wroth because he had found some commanding
officers away from their commands on hunting
excursions, and as it turned out, one of these
officers had talked to me on the up trip, and later
left in command one of his subalterns who had recently
joined from Vladivostok, and naturally could
not know I was prowling about in that part of
Siberia.</p>

<p>I preferred to leave General Graves puzzled as to
ignorance at that place about me, for if I had made
too full an explanation, the officer concerned, already
in the bad graces of his Commanding General, might
have been disciplined. And General Graves, travelling
in a special train with right of way over everything,
appeared to have no appreciation of the difficulty
of travel on intermittent passenger trains. And
some members of the personal staff, accustomed to
travel in such special trains, persisted in regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the trans-Siberian line as if it were part of, say, the
New York Central system. Being a Commanding
General has its disadvantages under such circumstances.</p>

<p>General Graves suggested that I go back to Bira.
As I had lost considerable sleep and worn out several
time-tables figuring out how I could go back to
Bira, I was in hearty accord with the General&#8217;s
wishes on the subject. And I eventually carried them
out. And certain officers, fully aware of what had
happened, told the General some time later that
trains on the trans-Siberian line could not be trusted
to make the time between different points which the
time-tables promised.</p>

<p>And up to the time I left Siberia, those in the
know generally greeted me at mess, with: &#8220;Go back
to Bira,&#8221; which always gave us a good laugh&mdash;at my
expense.</p>

<p>And by going back to Bira, I lost the trail of Red
Sweater, for the last sight I had of him, was from
that kitchen-car at Popperoffka. He was evidently
trailing General Graves&#8217;s special train.</p>

<small>OVER THE AMUR RIVER ON HORSEBACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I left Bira for Khabarovsk, I was without
an interpreter, for my soldier had gone on to
Khabarovsk from Popperoffka, ill. The train was so
crowded that there was no room for me in any of
the cars, and all I could do was load my heavy bedding-roll
and grip on between the cars, and then
stand outside with it.</p>

<p>The trip took all day, and till two the next morning.
The weather was too cold for comfort, despite
my heavy sheepskin coat. But a provodnik insisted
that I share his compartment.</p>

<p>Except for a little Russian, our conversation was
limited, but all through the day and night we entertained
each other, exchanging English and Russian
lessons. He claimed to be a Pole from Warsaw,
spoke German, Polish and Russian, and his eagerness
to learn English was pathetic. He asserted that
his one ambition was to get to America, and said he
had almost enough rubles to pay his passage, although
it developed that he did not know the price
of a ticket from Vladivostok to Japan, and thence
to San Francisco. He probably had more than
enough money to pay his passage, for the lowly provodnik<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
absorbs much money and smuggles many
commodities, from sugar to opium. And many provodniks
are German or Bolshevist agents&mdash;they
make an admirable system for &#8220;underground&#8221; lines
of communication.</p>

<p>The fact that I had to watch my baggage kept me
from getting meals from the stations along the line.
But the provodnik filled his tea-kettle with hot water,
we brewed tea, and he came in with a monstrous loaf
of bread and big consignment of reddish salmon-roe.
I never intended to eat the latter stuff, for I had
no gas-mask, but when my hospitable provodnik
plastered an inch of the stuff on a slice of bread and
handed it to me, I ate the eekrah to get the bread. I
enjoyed it quite as much as the baked sheep&#8217;s eyes
once served me by an Arab in the desert.</p>

<p>We reached Khabarovsk at two in the morning,
our passenger train coming into the yards in such
fashion that some six freight trains were between us
and the station, which is generally the case. As the
freights were being shifted about continuously, it
was impossible to attempt to go under them with my
baggage, and when, after an hour&#8217;s wait, I got a
porter, it appeared that we would spend the remainder
of the night running round the tracks of the
yard. For having gone a quarter of a mile to get
round a line of freight cars on one track, another
train on the next track would come rolling down
between us and the station. It was nearly daylight
when we got out of that moving labyrinth.</p>

<p>And the single drosky-driver at the station, knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
that he had a monopoly on my business, for all
the others had departed with incoming passengers,
demanded sixty rubles to take me to the American
post.</p>

<p>Without argument, I piled my baggage in,
clambered aboard, and then paid him his proper
twenty rubles at the end of the journey. He did not
demur&mdash;such methods proved to him that I was a
personage not to be trifled with. Had I given him
thirty, he would have chased me all night to get the
other thirty, for to display weakness by over-payment
puts one down as a person who can be brow-beaten
and robbed. Generosity in Siberia stamps the
stranger as a fool. And as a matter of fact, I paid
him double rate, for the Imperial rubles I gave him
were worth about twice the local paper money.</p>

<p>There was still a detachment beyond the Amur
River, about twenty versts away, which I had not
visited. Colonel Styer gladly provided me with a
horse, and a mounted orderly to ride to this station,
saving me the two days necessary to make the trip
by trains. And the Chaplain of the Twenty-seventh,
a hard-riding and hard-praying Southerner representative
of our best type of army chaplains, said
that he would go with me.</p>

<p>The trip was arranged while I was dining as the
guest of Colonel Styer and Chaplain <span class="nobr">W&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>Once more I was in quarters with Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrow, the regimental captain-adjutant,
<span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> and a second lieutenant, <span class="nobr">W&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who had
been commissioned from the ranks after several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
years in the regular army. The building was large
and roomy, having formerly been the residence of a
Russian officer and his family while a regiment of
Siberian Rifles had been stationed in Khabarovsk in
the old days. We used their silver and furniture,
their rich table covers, candelabra and samovars.</p>

<p>The walls of the house are four feet thick, with
hollow spaces between connected with the flues of
the many great stoves, in such way that the smoke
and heat from the fires circulate between the walls
before escaping from the chimneys. Fifty and sixty
degrees below zero are said to be usual winter temperature
there.</p>

<p>A stove in Siberia is not a stove at all, to use a
Hibernism, but a sort of tile temple built into the
wall, reaching from the floor to the ceiling. The
front of this structure merges with the surface of the
wall, and the tiles being of various colors and designs,
they add to the interior decorations. And it
is startling to come in of a cool evening and touch a
wall hot enough to suggest frying eggs upon it. My
memories of that house are permeated by a kindly
old Russian <i>moujik</i>, with long reddish beard, long
hair, wrinkled and blinking eyes. Whenever one had
occasion to pass him, he abased himself&mdash;he was a
most pathetic demonstration of the Russian style of
turning service into servitude. He seemed to spend
all the day and night stuffing wood into the fireboxes.</p>

<p>An old soldier who had been with Colonel Morrow
had charge of the servants; a soldier cook prepared
the meals, and the house work was done by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the blond <i>moujik</i>, a Russian woman and her daughter.
It was a happy place&mdash;what the veteran regular
calls &#8220;old army stuff,&#8221; meaning that everybody begins
by assuming that the other fellow is a gentleman,
knows his business, and attends to it without
attempting to look, talk or stand in imitation of von
Hindenburg. These latter traits afflict some persons
new to the uniform of an officer, because many
young men gained commissioned ranks without going
through the &#8220;shavetail&#8221; period of their training.
This term comes from the old style of shaving the
tail of a mule new to the army, which serves as sort
of a warning signal to such as may have dealings
with him, that the mule has not acquired proper discipline
and a regard for the feelings of others.</p>

<p>And no matter how high a cadet may stand in his
class at West Point, when he comes to the army, he
is a &#8220;shavetail officer,&#8221; for about a year, and admits
that he has a lot to learn about army ways. This is
one of the reasons why the old regular officers, and
the officer fresh from civil life, have not always gotten
on well together in the new army.</p>

<p>I do not always side with the regular. The regular
army had a splendid opportunity to send back to
civil life several thousands of temporary officers
with friendly feelings for the regulars, and an appreciation
of the professional training of the regular.
Instead, in too many cases, the regular officers
went out of their ways to point the fact that the
new officer was only an amateur at the game of soldiering.
The new officers, with a few exceptions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
never pretended to be anything else. They wanted
to learn, but they resented being humiliated while
learning.</p>

<p>As it happened, the regular army of England was
forced to enjoy a monopoly of the fighting in the
early days of the war, with the result that the regular
officers were almost entirely wiped out.</p>

<p>But one foolish amateur in an American expedition
generally resulted in all his fellows being judged
by his inefficiency and his foolishness. The regular
army would not wish to be judged by its worst types.
And I refer to these things here to point the fact
that if our regular officers had shown the same spirit
toward the strangers that Colonel Styer and the officers
of the Twenty-seventh United States Infantry
showed to the temporary officers of the Siberian Expedition,
the regular army would hold the respectful
deference of those men who have quit the officer&#8217;s
uniform for civilian garb.</p>

<p>Before we could cross the Amur to visit the detachment
near Khabarovsk, it was necessary for me
to have a pass for the big railroad bridge over the
river, issued by the headquarters of General Oi.
<span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the adjutant, arranged it for me through
the Japanese liaison officer.</p>

<p>We rode down through Khabarovsk, and out on
a road which would take us to the bridge. A guide
at headquarters said there was a passage over the
bridge for horses and foot-passengers, but he did
not go with us.</p>

<p>When we came to the bridge, we found that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
&#8220;passage for horses&#8221; consisted of nothing more than
loose planks laid lengthwise between the rails. And
outside the rails, between the steel girders, were
great openings big enough to let a horse go through,
in case he shied from between the rails. And if we
met a train, we would have to turn our horses and
come back.</p>

<p>This bridge over the Amur is nearly a mile long,
and consists of twenty-two spans supported by great
stone piers built up from the river bed. It may be
less than half a mile from the surface of the river,
but it appeared to be that far above the water as I
looked it over in contemplation of riding a horse
across it. I had crossed it twice by train, but late at
night, when I had not appreciated its grandeur, so
to speak.</p>

<p>There is a story that the Bolshevists planned to
blow it out, but that one Bolshevist leader had objected,
and threatened to shoot his comrade with the
explosives, if the bridge were destroyed, saying it
belonged to Russia, and so much wealth could not be
destroyed with his assent. That Bolshevist must
have been something of a patriot, for he saved the
bridge.</p>

<p>The Japanese guards examined my pass. I consulted
with <span class="nobr">W&mdash;&mdash;.</span> The horses seemed steady
enough, and I decided to attempt the crossing. So
starting off at a slow trot, I led the way. My horse
shuddered and snorted at first, but I did not allow
him to stop and think it over.</p>

<p>By the time we had crossed the first span, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
others were trailing behind. And everything went
well, till I came to planks which were underlaid with
sheets of corrugated iron. These made a tremendous
racket under the impact of the blows of the horse&#8217;s
feet on the loose planks, and he began to prance and
refused to go on. I dismounted, and without looking
back at him, led him across the bad stretch. He
followed meekly, and once we were clear of the
sheets, I mounted again, and went on at the slow
trot. So we went over and back again without mishap,
and found it not to be so foolhardy a crossing
as it had appeared to be at first glance.</p>

<p>My orderly was now out of hospital, and I arranged
to leave for Vladivostok. The train would
leave at one o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. At ten, I sent
the orderly-interpreter to the station, to get two tickets
and book accommodations for us. At eleven we
were at the station, in order to assure ourselves of a
seat, for the train came in a couple of hours before
it departed, and seats belong to those who get them,
regardless of seat-tickets or anything else, under that
system of &#8220;equality&#8221; which the Siberian has acquired.</p>

<p>All my effects were dumped from an army wagon,
in a blinding snow storm. The Cossack commandant
assured us that our seats would be preserved for us.
The train came in, and unloaded its passengers, and
immediately there was a wild scramble on the part of
peasants and Chinese, fighting their way into the
cars. The commandant was with my interpreter,
finding our places, so I waited an hour, having an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
abiding faith at that time in the polite assurances of
Cossack officers.</p>

<p>The interpreter came back looking disconsolate.
He said the Cossack had given up in disgust&mdash;there
was no room in the train for us. And the engine
tooting for an early start, with my baggage rapidly
becoming a snow drift!</p>

<p>I went to the station and found the Cossack officer.
I displayed my tickets, and cited the fact that I had
taken every precaution for transportation, and had
taken him at his word that he would be glad to reserve
seats for us. I demanded that he make good
his promises.</p>

<p>He displayed a most laudable energy, and going
aboard a car, opened the door of a compartment
despite the protests of four Russian men inside. He
waxed eloquent over the fact that an American officer
and soldier must travel on that train. They displayed
pistols, but finally gave way, and the six of
us sat down in the compartment. My baggage was
checked, and away we rolled.</p>

<p>It developed later that the reluctance of the four
men inside to admit anybody was due to the fact
that they were carrying large sums of railroad money
to Vladivostok. And they explained to the interpreter
that they had showed the pistols for the benefit
of the crowds in the passageway of the car, and
were willing enough that we should share the compartment
with them, for if we had not, they might
have had trouble with the exasperated travelers outside,
who were compelled to stand up all that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and most of the night, to get to Vladivostok. As it
turned out, we lived in that compartment as if in a
besieged fortress. At every station, new passengers
demanded admittance, and fought for some time to
be admitted, claiming that there was room to sit on
the two upper berths.</p>

<p>But the Russians drove them away with pistols,
and by asserting that the compartment belonged to
&#8220;the Americanskys.&#8221; And Russian women with children,
scowled at me through the narrow aperture of
the chained door which ventilated the compartment,
losing no opportunity by looks or remarks, to express
their opinions of people who came to Siberia
and prevented honest people from riding in comfort
in their own trains.</p>

<p>We got into Vladivostok about four o&#8217;clock the
next morning, and hiring three Chinese carriers, I
got my baggage to headquarters, and set up my cot
in the Intelligence Office.</p>

<p>During my absence, there had been a merry rumpus.</p>

<small>THE MACHINE THAT SQUEAKED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I found</span> Headquarters in Vladivostok seething
with secret turmoil. It seems that the Staff resented
the fact that fifteen Intelligence officers had been
sent by the War Department for duty in Siberia.
At least the Intelligence officers got that impression,
and they claimed that everything was being done to
discredit them, and upset the general plan of studying
the Siberian situation in detail if for no other
purpose than to watch the Intelligence machine work.</p>

<p>Although we did not know it, there had been some
minor troubles before we arrived. By the time the
<i>Sheridan</i> brought us, there had been one reorganization
of the Siberian military policy, which was
brought about by the arrival of General Graves, who
put into play methods of procedure reflecting the
administration policy of &#8220;non-interference.&#8221; This
meant putting a stop to everything which called for
any activity with the forces in Siberia, crushed any
ambition held by officers of the Twenty-seventh and
Thirty-first regiments of infantry for a campaign,
and resolved the whole situation into a matter of
marking time in quarters.</p>

<p>This is not a criticism of General Graves. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
he might prefer to do, compared with what his orders
were, is the difference between a good soldier
obeying his orders and a commander carrying out
the orders of his superiors. I believe that all concerned
obeyed their orders, and no higher compliment
can be paid to soldiers. If their orders are
not in accordance with their personal desires, all
the more credit to them for obeying. So in discussing
the situation as I found it in Vladivostok,
I wish to make it plain that I realized the difficulties
under which the Headquarters Staff labored. Its
prime business was to obey orders, not to be popular
with anybody, in or out of the expedition.</p>

<p>When the two regiments of infantry, tucked away
in the Philippines and apparently marooned from
the war, got orders to leave for Siberia, there was
great joy. For the regular officers it meant activity
and service stripes, and probably medals, and a campaign
in their records, and experience and a chance
for distinction. And many of these officers, due to
age, or the lottery of the service which sends some
officers to the front and immures others to a tropical
cloister, had given up all hopes of having a hand in
the war. Suddenly a new front was devised for
them, and they were rushed off to make history.</p>

<p>Colonel Styer was in command at Vladivostok,
and at that time there was every reason to believe
that there would be lively times. The two regiments
prepared themselves accordingly, and were ready
for swift and decisive action when they landed.
With the quiet efficiency of the regular, they overlooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
nothing in order to be ready for whatever
developed.</p>

<p>This little machine was running on a high gear,
when General Graves arrived. He drew the fires
and stopped the engine. Presently two more transports
arrived, with reinforcing troops, and our Intelligence
party, direct from Washington. Our officers
had presumably been selected for Siberian service
because they were experts in their various lines,
and necessarily being enthusiasts for their own line
of endeavor, showed great interest in the situation.</p>

<p>They laid down a barrage of questions on the
staff, ranging from where they were to sleep, to data
on the available coal supply from the Golden Horn
to the Urals. They had been cooped in a hotel and
a transport for some two months since leaving Washington,
some of them had never been away from the
United States, and they brought an element of romping
boyishness to the sedate, quiet and somewhat
bored staff. Some of them, though captains, had
never been near an army, and their civilian enthusiasms
jarred headquarters.</p>

<p>Having quelled one epidemic of enthusiasm, the
staff rather crossly and tactlessly set about stamping
out this fresh access of desire for picturesque action.
The staff, it was said, assumed the attitude
that it was competent to run the Siberian expedition
without the aid of a &#8220;lot of theorists and amateurs
from civil life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The younger officers on duty, fresh from West
Point and feeling much exalted at finding themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
wearing insignia of rank which in the old army sometimes
took twenty years to attain, reflected the attitude
of the elders, and two hostile camps developed
in a single building. And this was the war I walked
into, all unknowingly, when I came back from Khabarovsk.</p>

<p>I found myself &#8220;one of that Intelligence bunch,&#8221;
and no matter how politely I asked for some action
of a routine nature in order to carry out my own
orders, I found that the wheels did not turn for me.
Of course, there was not a flat refusal, but there was
what might be called &#8220;mental sabotage&#8221;&mdash;my requests
were forgotten till I had to resort to plain
language to get what I needed.</p>

<p>And the Intelligence party, I was informed, had
been summoned and told to &#8220;keep quiet, to betray no
initiative, not to criticise, and to keep busy doing
nothing.&#8221; And in order to nullify as far as possible
all attempts of the individuals of the party to accomplish
anything in their own lines of endeavor, the
&#8220;chart&#8221; of the organization was dismantled, and
each officer put at some duty with which he was unfamiliar.
For instance an expert on ciphers was sent
far into the interior, and an expert on maps was put
in charge of several translators, though he had a
most limited knowledge of Russian. And the Chief
of Intelligence found himself with some fifteen officers
who had been shipped half way round the world
at government expense, and drawing an average of
two hundred dollars a month in pay, buzzing indignantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
about his ears, and doing little but making his
life a burden.</p>

<p>Most of these officers were quartered in a warehouse
some five miles from headquarters, and an
irregular launch taking them back and forth across
the bay for meals, with the consequence that most
of the time was spent traveling or waiting on the
pier for the launch.</p>

<p>And when the launch was taken off the run, an
automobile was provided, which held five persons,
to transport a dozen officers and as many field clerks,
in a single trip, from and to quarters. About the
time the Intelligence detachment took ship for home,
a truck was provided. But in order to avoid the
loss of time in going back and forth, many of the
officers had hired at their own expense, rooms in
crowded Vladivostok.</p>

<p>There is something on the other side of the shield.
This obvious attempt to humiliate the Intelligence
detachment, probably grew out of the reports which
reached headquarters with us. The officer who had
been bedeviled by Smith in San Francisco, came in
the transport <i>Logan</i>.</p>

<p>He had apparently judged the whole party by
Smith, and had given us a bad repute. However
that may be, the Professor engaged by Smith as
&#8220;advisor,&#8221; as told in a previous chapter, got anything
but a pleasant reception when he came to report
his status.</p>

<p>As related to me, General Graves was most indignant
when he learned how and why the Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
had been thrust upon the expedition. He was told
that his services were not required, and he was paid
off at the rate allowed a field clerk. He refused to
acknowledge the money received as payment in full,
and charged poor Smith with having misrepresented
his authority, asserted that he had been damaged
by quitting his positions in San Francisco as undoubtedly
he had been, and took the return transport
threatening suit against Smith and a claim
against the government.</p>

<p>There is every reason to believe that this incident
established the &#8220;Intelligence bunch&#8221; as a group of
high-handed incompetents. The Staff to my mind,
had every reason for withholding from the members
of the party that measure of confidence and respect
which an Intelligence Department must have before
it can operate with any efficiency.</p>

<p>A Commanding General and his staff in a situation
such as confronted them in Siberia, has something
else to do beside test individually a lot of officers
who from previous acts by one or two of them
appeared to give every evidence of having no judgment.
It is safer to assume that they are all Smiths,
and put them at such simple tasks as insure that
they will not do something disastrous. It is also
cheaper to pay them to do nothing.</p>

<p>In time, most of the officers were sent away to
inland cities, where they remained as observers, till
they signified their desire for discharge after the
armistice in accordance with the terms of their commissions.
And in justice to the majority of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
officers, I wish to assert that they were highly efficient
in their various vocations, and that most of them
had distinguished themselves in civil life. One had
been minister for the United States to foreign countries
and was schooled as a diplomat; others were
professors of history and could tell the various life-careers
of big and small nations; some were ethnologists,
and could give the pedigree of any nondescript
person found in the motley throngs all over Siberia;
many had previously been in Russia several years,
spoke the language well, and found themselves in
familiar surroundings. With a few exceptions, they
did the duties of glorified office boys, while attached
to an expedition which needed above all things, an
alert and efficient system of Military Intelligence.
They did their best under disheartening conditions.</p>

<small>AN ARMY IMPRESARIO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a week or two after my return to Vladivostok,
I familiarized myself with the Intelligence organization
at Headquarters. So far as I could see,
we had no authority over anybody who happened
to be suspected of enemy activity, or actually guilty
of some act against the American or Russian laws.</p>

<p>When we found a man who had come in under a
fraudulent passport, and had in our files data which
proved him to be a Bolshevist agent, or sympathizer,
we could take no action, other than hold his American
passport. Then we notified the Czech commandant,
and he was arrested after passing from our
custody.</p>

<p>So we exercised no military or police authority
over anybody but our own nationals, or such Russians
or other foreigners as fraudulently claimed
American citizenship and attempted to travel as
such.</p>

<p>In order to watch the incoming ships, all the Allies
sent passport officers aboard them, and each officer
conducted the examination of his own nationals.
There was a line of Russian steamers, running between
Tsuruga, Japan, and Vladivostok, known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
the Russian Volunteer Fleet; and a similar line
owned by the Japanese. These little steamers served
as ferry-boats, gathering in Japan all travelers
bound for Vladivostok who arrived in ports of the
Far East in liners&mdash;this was the funnel through
which passed the stream of civilians who came first
to Shanghai, Nagasaki, Yokohama and other ports.</p>

<p>And before these steamers docked, they were
boarded by a Japanese, a Czech, a Russian, a British,
an American and a French officer, and the polyglot
lot examined before they were allowed to land.
I attended some of these examinations, provided
with a list of suspicious characters, and with the
various interpreters in action, the smoking-room put
to shame anything that must have been heard at the
Tower of Babel.</p>

<p>But so far as we were concerned, it was all a
silly farce. Technically, we had no right to examine
anybody. I once asked an Allied officer the
basis for his authority, whereupon he told me that
the city was under martial law, and controlled by an
Allied Council which delegated the powers of examination
to all the Allies. But this was promptly
denied by another Allied officer.</p>

<p>In fact, it appeared that we Americans, in an effort
to avoid interference, claimed no rights of control
over anybody on Russian soil, making it necessary
for us in order to question suspected enemies, to
resort to autocratic methods. That is, we disclaimed
all intentions of interfering and asserted no authority,
except this plan of going through the motions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
authority, which was a taking of power which might
have been granted had we asked for it.</p>

<p>For my part, I prefer an autocracy working in
the open, to a power which denies it is autocratic
and then proceeds to act autocratically without any
warrant. Such methods puzzled the decent Russians,
and they began to doubt the things which we
wanted them to believe, and which it was essential
that they believe if we were to have the confidence
of the Russian people.</p>

<p>A few days after I had raised the question of the
rights of the American officers in passport control,
we relinquished by order the rights we had been exercising.
When Russian or other officials held men
or women as suspicious, who professed to be American
citizens, they brought them to American headquarters,
where the examination took place. And
if the facts cited by them were refuted by our information,
we could do nothing but advise the Czechs
of the case, and let the latter act without any suggestions
from us, thus, like, Pilate, washing our hands
of the whole affair.</p>

<p>A Czech officer, upon being asked what he would
do with a certain suspect, said casually, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know&mdash;maybe we shoot him.&#8221; And maybe they did.
No doubt we had to &#8220;save our face,&#8221; and if the
Czechs were willing to serve us as jailers or executioners,
that took a disagreeable job off our hands.</p>

<p>I am not, mind, asserting that the Czechs dealt out
injustice, or that we should have executed anybody
or everybody arrested. I object to heads in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
government who lack decision as to what should be
done, and resort to chicane in attending to disagreeable
tasks. I object to an expedition being sent into
a country, the hands of the commander apparently
tied, and yet demanding that certain results be attained
in a left-handed manner so that the responsibility
may be shifted to other shoulders. This
country is altruistic and generous toward all other
nations in trouble, and we should demand from our
representatives who attend to our business, the kind
of leadership we are entitled to, and the clear demonstration
before such foreign peoples as we come into
contact with officially, of our honest motives.</p>

<p>From toying with various parts of the Intelligence
machine, I turned my attention to distributing fifty
cases of books which had been sent to the troops by
the American Library Association. Our men, living
in the stone-floored Russian barracks, which were
cold and damp and dirty, found these books most
welcome. It was a most dreary environment for
young and active men, most of them too far from
the city to get any entertainment from it, and when
its novelty was worn off, they found even Vladivostok
dull and disheartening.</p>

<p>The Chief of Staff suggested that a vaudeville
show be organized out of the forces, and I was put
in charge of it. Some fifteen men who had vaudeville
experience were detailed from various companies.
And to provide something with &#8220;local
color,&#8221; the Chief of Staff suggested that we might
hire a trio of Cossack dancers appearing at a local<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
cabaret known as the &#8220;Aquarium.&#8221; This show began
at midnight. The Chief of Staff, Donald
Thompson, the war-photographer, Mrs. Thompson
and myself, attended a performance. We sat
in a gallery box, and drank coffee from nickel coffee-machines
to keep us awake. It was a cheap and
tawdry show, and the floor below was filled with a
throng of people sitting at little tables and drinking
and eating. The Cossack trio&mdash;two brothers and a
young woman&mdash;gave an interesting exhibition of
Cossack dancing, interspersed with dialogue in Russian,
which delighted the doughboys present.</p>

<p>In a couple of days we put on a show of our own
at the Aquarium, which General Graves, and many
officers from all the Allied commands, attended as
his guests. We had gymnasts, black-face comedians,
vocal and stringed quartettes, and a regular vaudeville
program of some dozen acts, including the
Cossacks, with the regimental band of the Thirty-first
Infantry.</p>

<p>It was a &#8220;hit,&#8221; probably due to the fact that I interfered
not at all, but told the performers to &#8220;go
ahead and get your acts ready, tell me what you
will have, and we&#8217;ll write a program.&#8221; When you
want the American doughboy to do something outside
his regular line of duty, let him alone and he&#8217;ll
come home&mdash;he needs no Bo Peep.</p>

<p>The Cossacks were to provide two acts, one that
they supposed to be a refined American cake-walk,
done in conventional evening-dress, and the other
their dance, in native costume. Of course, they took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
more pride in their American act than in the dance,
which we wished to place in the program so that
it would be the &#8220;star&#8221; attraction.</p>

<p>It was suggested to them that they be third on
the bill with the cake-walk, to give them time to
rest and get into costume for the more strenuous
effort next to the finale. They agreed, perfectly
satisfied, and so they were billed.</p>

<p>I remained back stage. To my horror, when
the act preceding the cake-walk was in progress,
and the Cossacks were called from the dressing-room
somewhere in the cellar, they appeared in
their outlandish Cossack costume and makeup.
For this act they required stage-sets and improvised
lighting, which of course were not ready at
that time.</p>

<p>I told my interpreter to ask them to change as
quickly as possible, as they must have misunderstood
the agreement about how their acts were placed on
the program. But they averred that they had simply
changed their minds, and intended to do the Cossack
dance first, because the regular Aquarium show
followed ours, and they would have to do their exhausting
dance twice almost in succession if they
appeared on our bill last.</p>

<p>I was willing enough to announce the change, and
let it go at that, but although I surrendered to their
wishes, they persisted in continuing a loud and long
Russian conversation behind the curtain in competition
with the monologuist who was amusing the audience.
Then, when it was all settled that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
appear immediately in the dance, they changed their
minds again, and went below to change costumes at
the moment they should have gone on.</p>

<p>Luckily the monologuist got several encores, and
being known to many of the soldiers out front, they
demanded certain of his stories, and he pieced his
act out long enough to conceal the wait for the
Cossacks.</p>

<p>This example of mental instability I found to be
typical of most Siberians&mdash;they will spend hours
settling a problem, and having threshed out all the
details, and arrived at a logical conclusion, somebody
remarks: &#8220;Maybe we are wrong after all,&#8221;
and away they go again on the argument, from the
beginning, getting themselves more enmeshed in
doubts than ever, and finally have to quit in exhaustion
without reaching any decision.</p>

<p>Before we could start touring with our show, the
Cossacks had to go to Nikolsk-Ussuri to fill an engagement
at that place. And our troupe had to get
costumes and rehearse, cars must be provided for
winter travel, and we had to work out songs with
the members of the band.</p>

<p>When the Chief of Staff engaged the Cossack
trio, it was at the rate of four thousand rubles a
month and all expenses, food and quarters. At that
time, with the current rate of rubles, which was ten
rubles for the dollar, the salary stood us four hundred
dollars. But having in mind the dollar basis,
the deal was made in rubles. When I went to Nikolsk
to advise the Cossacks that we were ready for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
them, rubles had gone to six for a dollar, so were
more valuable&mdash;and of course, the Cossacks wanted
their pay in rubles.</p>

<p>They reached Vladivostok late at night, and with
the city over-crowded, they had difficulty in getting
quarters. They were temporarily sent to a Russian
house across the bay, and then a fourth-class car
was arranged for them on the siding at the Base.
The weather was getting very cold, the car was unsatisfactory
to them, they objected to being halted
by our sentries when they came to the car late at
night, and despite two stoves kept going by a German
war prisoner, they said they nearly froze to
death.</p>

<p>I began to understand some of the troubles of impresarios
with foreign &#8220;artists.&#8221; They objected to
rehearsing with our band at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning,
the only time the band had available time, because
they were accustomed to getting their breakfasts
at eleven&mdash;they talked the most violent Russian
at me at all times possible, regardless of
whether my interpreter was present or not. I was
sorry for them.</p>

<p>At this stage of affairs, I got sudden orders to
proceed to Chita, two thousand versts away, and
take station as the American officer on Intelligence
duty. There were no American troops there, and
it was reported that the American officer of Philippine
Scouts whom I was to relieve, had been threatened
with assassination. My &#8220;circus&#8221; was turned
over to another officer, and with my interpreter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
First Class Private Werkstein, I went aboard a Red
Cross train bound for the front, to take station at
Chita, Trans-Baikal, where Ataman Semenoff had
his headquarters with his Cossack and Mongol
army.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII<br />


<small>AWAY TO TRANS-BAIKAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> Red Cross Train left Vladivostok just before
midnight, December 11, 1918. It consisted
chiefly of box-cars full of medical supplies and clothing
bound for Omsk; there was an International
sleeping car for some twenty Red Cross nurses, Russian
women doctors, American missionaries from
Japan serving as refugee workers, dentists and physicians.
Some of the men had just arrived in Siberia
from Manila, and some of the women from Japan,
and knew little of travel on a Siberian train. There
were two men sent out by our War Trade Board to
investigate the supply of raw materials and the
wants of the people for manufactured goods. The
sleeping car compartments for four persons, had to
accommodate six.</p>

<p>The train had been combined with a Czech train,
carrying supplies for the Czech army at the front,
and two fourth-class cars were provided for Czech
soldiers. There was also a fourth-class car full of
wounded and sick Czech soldiers, most of the latter
suffering from tuberculosis, to be left at Buchedo, a
station far up the line where there was a hospital.</p>

<p>An American Infantry captain bound for Harbin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to take command of a company there, serving as
guard for the consulate, shared quarters with me in
one of the fourth-class cars, with the Czech soldiers,
and my interpreter, Werkstein, was with me.</p>

<p>There was a dining-car improvised out of a small
and springless ordinary box-car, by building a range
into one end, cutting a door in the other, and building
a table down the center. Along the sides were
piled our food supplies, our bread hanging in sacks
from the roof, and under the table our feet rested
on frozen cabbages, potatoes, and beef.</p>

<p>The cook got off now and then, and having, with
mere money, wheedled the &#8220;starving populace&#8221; into
parting with fat pheasants, threw the dead and
frozen birds into the cook-car with brutal disregard
of the needs of the natives. And as a further example
of dire necessity, of food shortage, I observed
at one place some peasants (not pheasants) so close
to starvation, that they had nothing with which to
grease the wheels of their wagons but best Siberian
butter! We heard about this time by cable that the
Congress of the United States would be asked to appropriate
a hundred million dollars for the purchase
of food, which food was to be sent to wheatless and
meatless Europe in order to prevent the spread of
Bolshevism&mdash;that same Bolshevism which had swept
Siberia &#8220;as the result of a lack of food.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang, a wily Chinese, bossed the &#8220;China boys&#8221;
who did the cooking and waited on the table. And
a place at the table generally meant being frozen,
or roasted, according to whether one sat at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
away from a red-hot stove near the door, or near
the stove. And it seemed that the engineer picked
out the roughest part of the road-bed to show his
best speed, when we were at meals.</p>

<p>A doctor once asked me to pass the cheese. At the
same instant, we hit a curve, and a whole round of
cheese from the top of the pile of stores behind him
over his head, toppled over, sailed over him and
alighted on his coffee.</p>

<p>As we got into Manchuria, the temperature
dropped to about forty degrees below zero. The
door of the diner, from which emerged the warm
air, was draped in great icicles, and when the door
was opened, we were met by a rush of steam&mdash;the
warm air meeting the cold.</p>

<p>The women nurses, having modern ideas of ventilation,
left the windows of their compartments
slightly open one night. In the morning the heating-pipes
in that car were useless, for it was a hot-water
system, and the provodnik had allowed the fires in
the heater to go down during the night. The sleeping
car, for the rest of the trip, might have served
well as a cold-storage car.</p>

<p>With two stoves going continually in our fourth-class
car, even though they burned Manchurian coal
and gave off a yellow smoke, most of which escaped
into the car, kept us comfortable. We were warm,
if not sanitary. And when the weather got to sixty
below, I gave up all ideas of hoping for fresh air
while sleeping.</p>

<p>And during the day, at every stop, we three Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
got out for air, risking having our feet frozen
in the process. The Czechs did not seem to mind&mdash;they
went on with their cooking, and stoked the
fires all the harder to warm the air we had cooled
by opening the doors to go out.</p>

<p>Everything that was metal inside, became covered
with heavy frost&mdash;pistols, iron braces, nail-heads,
bolts. And to touch any of the iron work with bare
hands, getting on or off the car, meant leaving a
palm sticking to the iron.</p>

<p>At the same time that the water-bucket on the
floor under my bunk was freezing solid, when I
stood up to dress my head was in smothering heat
gathered at the top of the car. And the passing
landscape was obscured by tropical foliage, etched in
frost, on the double windows.</p>

<p>In such a climate, I can well understand that the
Russian peasant cares little who rules in Petrograd,
for his mind is concerned only with having food,
shelter and warmth. Such cold probably accounts
for much of the mental stupefaction of the Siberians,
and explains why the Czars held their power so long.</p>

<p>When Siberia was chosen as a place of exile, to
cure people of thinking, the person who selected
that frozen land for prisons doubtless knew what
terrible cold will do to the human brain. It killed
many exiles, but it acted as a preservative of their
ideas, and they bided their time, waiting for a chance
to get freedom, so that they might go on a spree
of destruction. It will take more than a few months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
of education to turn such people from their age-old
lessons in oppression, cruelty and annihilation.</p>

<p>There was a merry wag among the Czechs. He
had lost two front teeth, he was poorly clad, but he
relished his soup, enjoyed his sleep, and was always
smiling and chattering gaily. One cold night, when
we were out of coal, he dug from his boxes a gorgeous
robe, blue outside and embellished with red
decorations of barbaric design. It was lined with
long, white Angora-goat wool. As he wrapped himself
in it, he looked like some Mongolian prince,
preparing for a royal audience.</p>

<p>This garment roused my curiosity. He said it was
from the Khirgiz tribes. I asked its price, and
Werkstein interpreted this:</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose life?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who had it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who had it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Bolshevist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did it cost him his life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I killed him and took it.&#8221; The wag
smiled a gentle smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;He got that rifle, and that pistol he has, from
the same man,&#8221; said Werkstein. And the wag rolled
up and went to sleep, evidently not at all concerned
about the ghost of the Bolshevist who had owned
the robe.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was in an Austrian regiment,&#8221; continued
Werkstein, giving me some of the merry one&#8217;s history.
&#8220;He deserted with his regiment to the Russians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
for the Czechs did not want to serve the Germans.
In reprisal, the little business he had at home
was confiscated, his wife became crazy when his two
children were taken away, and he does not know
what became of any of them. He is waiting now
to get back to that Austrian village, and he swears
he will kill till he is killed when he gets there. He
does not care what happens to him&mdash;he will get his
revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without doubt the wag will.</p>

<p>In about a week we arrived in Harbin, and
stopped there some three days. The city appeared
very dull by day, but at night the restaurants and
theatres were crowded with gay throngs.</p>

<p>I found a young officer on duty there, who had
shared my stateroom on the transport, and we dined
at the Hotel Moderne. The prices were extremely
high, but the food excellent. The restaurant was
full of Russian officers, and wealthy civilians, for
Harbin is really the center of high life for the Siberians,
it being in Manchuria and somewhat safer
than other cities.</p>

<p>Here gather all the intriguers of all factions, here
are hatched the plots and counter plots of the monarchists
and anti-monarchists, the Bolshevists and
anti-Bolshevists of Siberia.</p>

<p>The man who seeks power and wishes to draw to
him his adherents, goes first to Harbin to perfect
his plans, and the man who has lost power, goes
there to escape the fury of the populace and lay his
plans for regaining his old position. It is quite likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
that among the crowd at the opera that night, there
were former Grand Dukes waiting till the time is
ripe for a <i>coup d&#8217;etat</i>; if the former Czar is still
alive, he is probably hidden away in Harbin, and if
a Romanoff ever returns to the throne, Harbin will
probably harbor the heads of the plot for the restoration.</p>

<p>Among the Russians I met there, was a nephew
of Tolstoy, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant. But
officers of higher rank appear to prefer civilian attire.
And when introduced to them, I found that the
ranks mentioned with their names, were pronounced
in low tones. And it is not at all uncommon to be
introduced to somebody with the name given in a
conversational tone, and later to have whispered to
you, the real name and title of the new acquaintance.</p>

<p>Judging from some of the acts of the cabaret
near the Moderne, Harbin is not wholly a royalist
center. A singer, in the rags and chains of a Siberian
convict, sang in dismal notes the story of his sufferings,
and &#8220;died&#8221; on the stage. He had to respond
to a dozen encores.</p>

<p>But I suspected some of the excessive applause to
come from persons who were of the old nobility, if
not of imperial blood. Living incognito in Harbin,
it might not be safe for a Grand Duke to hiss such
an act, and in such a case, a man may save himself
from assassination by bursting his white gloves in
sympathy for a stage exile.</p>

<p>We took on food supplies at Harbin, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Czechs loaded their cars with cigarettes and wine
for a Christmas celebration at the front.</p>

<p>They had one car nearly full of cases of wine,
and worried lest it might freeze. They consulted
me about it, but not knowing the amount of alcohol
it contained, I refused to give an opinion as to what
might happen to it in such frigid weather. So they
set up a stove in the car, and took turns keeping
the fire going, day and night.</p>

<p>The hardships of a Siberian winter, with famine
stalking about, can only be realized when you face
the problem of keeping a whole car-load of wine
from freezing in sixty-below temperature. The soldiers
who were not on duty sitting up with the wine,
spent the nights in my car, where I was trying to
sleep. They talked about the danger to the wine&mdash;talked
in ear-torturing Czecho-Slovak. They also
rambled around with candles that leaked wax upon
the countenances of their sleeping Allies. Rest was
not for those Czechs (nor for anyone else), and
their faithfulness and fortitude in preserving that
wine is a thing to stick in the memory. They ought
to be decorated. A certain irritable Red Cross agent
came near doing it.</p>

<p>We passed many hospital trains coming from the
front, filled with sick and wounded Russians and
Czechs. And it was on this trip that I saw the awful
refugee trains, with box-cars full of men, women and
children suffering from typhus and other diseases.</p>

<p>And it was said that one of these trains, having
come thousands of miles carrying dying and dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
huddled together in straw, were turned back at a
certain station by the Russians, because they feared
contagion. And from these cars were taken many
dead, frozen and lying among the sick. And from
the crevices of the floors of the cars, and from the
interstices under the doors, hung great red icicles!</p>

<p>I observed many educated Russians look at such
scenes with little sympathy. At least, their attitude
was that the people had brought such sufferings upon
themselves by overthrowing the throne of the Emperor.</p>

<p>While waiting for the &#8220;second table&#8221; in the diner,
I had occasion to discuss the country with a young
Russian woman, bound for Perm to seek her father
and mother, from whom she had not heard in a
year and a half. There had been much fighting there
with the Bolshevists, and she was unaware of the
fate of her parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father superintended the building of this section
of the railroad,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I lived with him on
his private car as the line was built through this part
of the country, so I know every mile well. Little I
dreamed then that my great country would be ruined
as it is now. Court life was so fine&mdash;the fine clothes,
the nobility, the great dinners, and the imperial
dances&mdash;it is too bad that all such things are gone.
Maybe they will come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the people suffered under that r&eacute;gime,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>She looked at me with surprised eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suffered! They were never so happy, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
will never be so happy again. They do not know
what they want. I went into a refugee barrack last
month outside Vladivostok, and found there an old
woman who had been one of our servants for years.
She was afraid to speak to me&mdash;afraid that I would
be marked as one of the aristocracy, and probably
suffer for it. But I talked with her&mdash;and how she
wished that she were back in our happy home. She
knows she was better off with us in the old days,
than she can ever hope to be again. She would
have lived a few more years in peace and comfort as
our servant, and wanted nothing. Now she will
probably have to live and die as a beggar. The poor
people suffer more by this than the wealthy do&mdash;even
if a few rich people are killed, and their property
taken. My Russia was all right, as it was. And
if I don&#8217;t find my father and mother, I am going to
South America.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an individual attitude, the expressions of this
young woman might not be regarded of much value,
or at all typical of the well educated Russian. Yet I
found her ideas to be general with all the better
class Russians I met&mdash;that Russia under the old
r&eacute;gime was an ideal country, and that the peasant
and servant classes were as happy as they wished to
be, and better off than they would be if they lived
under a democratic form of government which gave
them all a hand in the government.</p>

<p>It is an attitude similar to that held in the South
regarding our negro slaves&mdash;they were better off as
slaves, than they could be if free. It is a feudal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
frame of mind, in which it is granted that there are
two classes of people in the country, those who know
all and have all, and those who are inherently inferior
in brain quality and so require to be held in
leash, giving their labor in exchange for such kindnesses
as the over-lord wishes to dispense to them.</p>

<p>This mental attitude toward an inferior class,
held by the upper class of Russia, accounts for the
American failure, generally speaking, to understand
Russia and the Russians. We persist in thinking of
all Russians as the same, with the exception that some
are better educated than the others, when as a matter
of fact there are two different peoples in Russia.
One is a class which expects as a matter of course
to have all the best things which the country provides,
and the government is merely a system upon
which hangs a social code, and which gives out orders,
titles of nobility, and administrative positions
which provide incomes.</p>

<p>In a way, the feudal attitude in old Russia was
the proper one, provided the ideal feudal system
was carried out; that is, if the over-lords all used
their power to lift up such of their menials as gave
evidence of being possessed of some mental ability.</p>

<p>But the feudal system as it operated, granted no
mental ability to any underling, or &#8220;low-born&#8221; person,
and worked with no other object than to keep
the low-born submerged, and lift to power and position
even worthless members of the upper class.</p>

<p>The son of the noble who could not pass his
examinations, graduated from the university and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
despite profligacy and licentiousness, rose to power
in the government.</p>

<p>The commoner, though displaying great brilliance,
found himself unable to pass in his examinations
year after year if he ever entered the university
at all, and had to give up in despair. But in the
arts, genius succeeded, and produced authors and
painters&mdash;and the result was that all writers of great
natural ability became revolutionists.</p>

<p>Through them we got our sympathy for the peasants,
and as these writers understood that the lower
classes were victimized and exploited by the system,
they presented to us all Russians as people of great
ideals&mdash;they extolled the virtues of the exploited and
minimized their faults and limitations. At the same
time, they depicted with great power all the cruelties
of the ruling classes.</p>

<p>Thus the Russian peasant reasoned that he had no
faults, that if he had the power he could produce
an ideal government, and that because the ruling
classes ruled badly, all that was needed to run the
nation was a kind and generous heart. Thus also
the Bolshevist leaders found it easy to take the Empire
into their hands. The upper class of Russia
made Bolshevism possible by keeping the lower class
ignorant. And ignorance is the greatest menace to
any nation&mdash;the spark in a powder magazine.</p>

<p>As we went eastward, I studied the people, keeping
in mind the attitude of the young woman who felt
that Russia was ruined because all the good things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
she had known were gone, and because the peasants
were worse off than ever.</p>

<p>And I found that the peasants did not consider
themselves any the worse for having destroyed the
old r&eacute;gime; at least, they seemed willing to endure
the hardships they had imposed upon themselves, in
the hope that in due time things would be better.</p>

<p>But my feeling was that they will never live to see
things bettered, no matter how long they may live.
There may be less disorder of a kind, but I doubt
if these people will ever escape being exploited till
they have acquired a leaven of education. But to
educate them in the sense by which we define education,
means to change their whole mental attitude
toward themselves, their country, and life in general.</p>

<p>To the Russian of the lower class, who has been
inarticulate for generations, there are no degrees
of education. He does not realize that among a
thousand persons who have, say, graduated from a
university in the same class, all members of which
have taken the same courses of study, there is any
variation of intellect, and difference in ability, any
deeper sense of meanings of things in one individual
than in another. Why should there be? he asks. Are
they not all educated? He thinks of education, as a
certain moment in which the student becomes aware
of all knowledge, and acquires all wisdom. And
to the primitive minds of these people, &#8220;education&#8221;
means the ability to read, write, and figure.</p>

<p>At one station where we changed train crews, a
big fellow, with a gigantic wooly cap, came into our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
car and sat by the stove. His assistants paid him
much deference. He began to talk with the Czechs,
and once set going, went on like a great phonograph.
The Czechs finally ignored him, and he began to
question Werkstein, my interpreter. Werkstein had
difficulty in concealing his amusement at some of the
things the big fellow said, and I got into the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;This chap is educated,&#8221; said Werkstein. &#8220;That
is why the provodnik and the brakeman sit here and
listen to him talk&mdash;they feel that they are learning
something. They almost worship him because he can
tell them things he has read in books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What books has he read?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Gorky,
Puskin, Tolstoy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The conductor threw up his hands in a delirium
of joy as he heard me pronounce the names of the
Russian novelists. Now he could show his fellows
that he could talk to the American on common
ground.</p>

<p>But when I asked him to name some of the works
of these writers that he had read, he pushed back
his cap and scratched his head with a ponderous
paw. He could not remember the titles&mdash;but he had
read all their works. But he was utterly ignorant
of anything Tolstoy or Gorky had written&mdash;he
merely recognized the titles when they were mentioned.</p>

<p>He changed the subject by asserting that we
Americans wanted all Russians to agree on a government,
when we Americans could not agree on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
own. I agreed that there were some differences of
opinion as to government in our country, but that
in general we agreed fairly well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you have so many presidents?&#8221; he
asked in triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;We try to have but one,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have more than fifteen now,&#8221; he replied,
and dug his elbow into the ribs of a brakeman sitting
behind him, to indicate that he had made a point
which I could not refute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot remember their names,&#8221; he asserted,
but holding up a hand, he began to count on his
fingers: &#8220;You have presidents in Brazil, Argentine,
Chile, Mexico, <span class="nobr">&mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</span> The Czechs interrupted him
with roars of laughter, and Werkstein explained to
me. But he insisted that he was right.</p>

<p>He switched to a map of his own country, a lithograph
advertising American harvesting machinery,
and showing by red spots the size of a dime, the location
in Russian cities of their agencies. Naturally,
the spot over Petrograd was as large as the spots
on the smaller cities in the grain districts of Siberia,
but he proudly asserted that all these spots represented
cities the size of Petrograd. No, he had
never been to Petrograd, but was it not as big as
Harbin?</p>

<p>India, he said, was somewhere near Japan. He
had read of Venice, and its streets of water, but
Venice was not in Italy. How could it be in Italy?
Venice was somewhere in Europe, and Italy was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
in Europe&mdash;the book he had read about Venice had
stated that Venice was not in Italy, and he stuck by
the book.</p>

<p>This man was educated to his fellows. &#8220;If this
man should go to a small Russian town, and read
from a newspaper for the people of that town, he
could become mayor,&#8221; said Werkstein. &#8220;He is so
ignorant that he thinks he knows a lot.&#8221; Which is
not an uncommon delusion, even out of Siberia.</p>

<p>He was also in sympathy with the Bolshevists,
having as his only argument in their favor, the fact
that they were &#8220;good people.&#8221; Now this man, being
a conductor, had a considerable influence over such
peasants as he met, for as a railroad man he travelled
much, and as an &#8220;educated man,&#8221; had read
much. Many gave heed to what he said. And compared
to thousands of Siberians that I encountered,
his intellect was amazingly powerful.</p>

<p>Yet at home I found people who felt that the
peasants of Siberia know what they are doing, and
are actuated by a desire to create a democratic government,
and that in a short time they will, and
operate it. But Siberia will fall a prey to some autocrat,
who will rule it by the sword, independently of
Petrograd. Such a vast and such a rich territory,
peopled with human beings in the darkness of the
Middle Ages, can have no other fate.</p>

<p>Our progress was delayed for various reasons, the
chief one being the fact that wrecks occurred ahead
of us with startling frequency. As a matter of fact,
Bolshevists, or Bolshevist sympathizers, or railroad men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in Bolshevist pay, were causing the wrecks. It
was all a system of sabotage, and being done to
hamper the Allies in every way from opposing the
Bolshevists who were fighting.</p>

<p>And as we came into the yards of Manchuria
Station, or Mandchuli, at about daylight one morning,
switches were thrown in such a way that our
train, laden with medical supplies for Russian
wounded and sick, and with one car full of women
nurses, was derailed, and put on three tracks. The
immunity which we might have claimed from being
wrecked, was lost because we had combined with a
Czech military train.</p>

<p>Our Czech commandant took a squad of soldiers
to the station, and demanded the man who had derailed
us. But the station-master asserted that the
culprit had disappeared. So no vengeance was
taken.</p>

<p>It was forty below zero that morning. The
shaggy camels that passed us, appeared to wear
great white coats, for every hair on their bodies
stood out straight, covered with frost. So we had
breakfast in the station restaurant, and waited
through the day for the railroad men to get us back
on the rails.</p>

<p>I found the American officer on Intelligence duty
at that station, living in a Russian home, and we
went and lunched with the Railroad Engineers of the
Stevens contingent. One of them was an excellent
cook, and we had a splendid meal, the prize of the
household being a large jar of gooseberry jam. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
house was fairly good, but despite its massive proportions,
cold as Greenland. And in the time I spent
in Siberia, I never found a house or a hotel that was
comfortably warm, even when I was clad in the
heaviest clothing, except the house occupied by
Colonel Morrow in Khabarovsk.</p>

<p>We arrived in Chita, Trans-Baikal, thirteen days
after leaving Vladivostok. As I looked out that
morning, over a drear landscape partly concealed by
frozen fog, I had in mind the thousands of exiles who
had marched overland to Chita, for the city in the
old days had been a distributing point for convict
labor destined for the mines to the north.</p>

<p>It was fifty degrees below that morning. I saw a
low, white plain, shut in on three sides by hills,
studded with huts. The huts were marked by white
pillars of steam rising straight into the sky&mdash;warm
air escaping from the chimneys. The station door
was shrouded with ice, and whenever it opened
there was a burst of white steam outward, but upon
entering there was no steam inside&mdash;only a warm,
odoriferous air. Great icicles over the door, some of
them a foot through, are characteristic of public
buildings in that country during the cold weather.</p>

<p>We learned that we had passed through the city
station of Chita, and had come three versts beyond
to &#8220;Pervia Chita,&#8221; or First Chita, that being the
name of the first station built as the building of the
road progressed toward Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Werkstein got a man with a pony and a cart, and
we loaded our baggage. Then, trailing along after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
it, walking in order not to freeze our feet, we skirted
the railroad, and came to a railroad bridge over a
gully, which was to lead us to Chita proper.</p>

<p>But just as our wagon approached the bridge, a
Russian ran out of a hut, and let down bars, blowing
a horn loudly meanwhile. Our pony had to stop, and
we had to wait.</p>

<p>We spent the time walking to and fro in an effort
to keep warm. Werkstein said there was a train
coming, and the bridge guard could not let us cross
after he had been warned. And the time between
when the guard closed the bridge, and the freight
train crossed and we were allowed to pass, was
forty-five minutes. At both ends of the bridge long
lines of traffic had been held up, and men and horses
obviously suffered greatly from cold. But <i>Nitchyvo</i>!
The people are too good-natured to protest. What
does it matter? Nothing, except that I have observed
in lands where people are noted for their
good nature, those people bow their necks under the
yoke of a foreign conqueror.</p>

<p>There is a system of philosophy used as a thesis
for happy books in the United States, somewhat
akin to New Thought, which can see no evil in any
thing or any person. The heroes and heroines of
such books being depicted as living in happy American
homes, insist that everybody should be happy
and can be happy, merely by seeking happiness. But
while these youngsters are being happy, father is
making money, and somebody does a deal of work
that the machinery of government, and the machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of modern life, may be kept going. And such
books sell by the millions to American people. Happiness
should not be the result of wearing mental
blinders. For the curse of Russia was not the Czar,
but the peasants <i>Nitchyvo</i>&mdash;&#8220;no matter.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE CITY OF CONVICTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> first impressions of Chita were good. It had
an excellent though dirty station, and the buildings
were substantial, most of those in the business district
being of stone or brick. There were two big
Russian churches, a synagogue, and a Mohammedan
mosque, two local newspapers being published
intermittently, banks which did not at that time boast
of their assets, trade-schools, high schools, and a
school conducted by the clergy but which was temporarily
closed, its building having been commandeered
by Ataman Semenoff, the chief of the Trans-Baikal
Cossacks, for an officers&#8217; school. The population
was between fifty and sixty thousand. There
were two fairly good hotels, the better one held by
Semenoff as quarters for his officers and their families.</p>

<p>The streets were wide and laid in straight lines.
And oddly enough, in a country which we assume to
be buried in snow during the winter, to walk the
streets meant to sink ankle-deep in dust. All the
snow I saw in Chita was a mantle of fine particles on
ground which was not disturbed by traffic. It was
too cold to snow.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>We found the officer I was to relieve in the Hotel
Dayooria. The room was dark, because the single
window was an inch thick with frost. But there was
an electric drop-light. On the window-sill were tea,
sugar, bread and a mess-kit. The scant furniture
was dangerous to use, for the Bolshevists had gone
through the hotel and wrecked it.</p>

<p>I was offered a room for myself and interpreter
which was bare of furniture, the walls stripped clean
of paper, the window repaired poorly, at the rate of
twenty-five rubles per occupant, or at the then rate
of exchange, about five dollars a day for both.</p>

<p>The halls were filthy dirty, and the odors nauseating.
The toilet on the main floor had plumbing, but
not water, and it had been in use for several months.
There was no light in it, and its ventilation was attended
to by the door which opened into the dirty
hall. The place made its presence known throughout
the building, and neither proprietor nor Russian
guests felt that there was anything out of the ordinary
in their surroundings.</p>

<p>To travel over the country and find such conditions
everywhere, regarded by the native population
as normal, and then to hear of epidemics which
were being fought by the Red Cross doctors, and
thousands of dollars in medical supplies and medicines
being shipped into the country as gifts from the
American people, made me wonder if it would not
be better to first use a knout on those responsible for
insanitary conditions beyond description or belief.</p>

<p>There was a great clamor about the danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
typhus, and our medical men, military and civilian,
were much concerned about its spread. There were
slips of paper distributed, printed in Russian, telling
what to do when afflicted with typhus. It was described
as a disease caused by body vermin, and urging
personal cleanliness. I have seen many Siberians
read that warning, while they casually scratched
themselves. Generally speaking, the people regard
lice as things which create a slight discomfort, but
are not worthy of much attention&mdash;about on a par
with flies.</p>

<p>One thing the Siberian does thoroughly&mdash;he takes
a funeral seriously. He turns it into a dramatic pageant,
and no detail is overlooked. But he will not
turn his hand over to take any precaution against
disease, or the conditions that create it. I asked
several Siberians, merely to get their attitudes, if it
would not be well to improve sanitary conditions.
&#8220;You will all be sick and die,&#8221; I said to one man.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may be sick, but we will not die,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What if we are sick? The Americanskys are sending
medicines to cure us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably if we demanded good sanitary conditions
before we would supply medical goods, we
would be interfering with the people. But if we
were going to contribute medicines to a locality at
home which allowed breeding spots for disease all
over the locality, I am willing to wager that we
would demand an improvement of the sanitation,
and see that it was accomplished, even if we had to
use some kind of force.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>One of my first duties was to call upon Lieutenant
General Oba, commanding the Japanese division,
with headquarters at Chita. The Japanese staff occupied
a four-story department store which covered
an entire block. This building had been swept clean
of its contents by looting Bolshevists.</p>

<p>It happened that the Chief of Intelligence in our
forces, had been in Chita several days, and was preparing
to return to Vladivostok. He went with me
to Oba&#8217;s headquarters, and we took with us a Y. M. C. A.
man who had been a missionary in Japan and
who spoke Japanese well.</p>

<p>In the hall there was a wooden dial on a table,
with a wooden arrow. In sectors of the circle, were
written Japanese and Russian sentences, arranged so
that when you read the Russian sentence which applied
to the officer you wished to call upon, and
turned the arrow to that sector, it also pointed to a
translation in Japanese. Then the guard on duty
learned from this automatic interpreter, your business,
and sent your card in to the proper officer.</p>

<p>We were conducted to a room where we removed
our heavy coats and furs, and presently we were
ushered into the presence of Oba. He is a small
man, of dignified but unassuming manners, and most
amiable. I liked him extremely. If I remember correctly,
his foreign training was French, and I missed
the Germanic bluntness and the striving for dignity
which so many Japanese officers have as the result
of acquiring or copying German military manners.</p>

<p>Most Japanese officers who attain high rank are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
in addition to being accomplished soldiers, astute
diplomats. At least that is the impression they give
me. It may be that what I ascribe to astuteness, is in
reality an avoidance of discussing many of the things
which other foreign officers will discuss together
with more or less frankness. Silence is often mistaken
for great wisdom. It may be wise to be silent&mdash;if
one wishes to appear wise. In a newspaper
experience covering nearly a quarter of a century,
I have sometimes found many men supposed to be
oracles, merely to be clams. Once they could be induced
to talk, their limitations were apparent.</p>

<p>I would say that Oba has all the French love of
conversation, and in addition is most frank. There
was no reason why he should plunge into a discussion
of Japan in Siberia, and there was no reason
why he should be more than formally polite. Yet
every time I had occasion to call on Oba, he made
me feel thoroughly at home, and such occasions
proved to be in the nature of a pleasure rather than
an official ordeal. His abilities as a soldier I do not
doubt, but I believe he would serve Japan well as a
diplomat.</p>

<p>Technically, it was proper to call first upon Ataman
Semenoff, but at that time he was confined to
his bed suffering from the wounds inflicted by a bomb
thrown at him in a theatre of Chita. So we called
upon his chief of staff, General Verego. There was
much intrigue in Semenoff&#8217;s little army of some five
thousand, and Verego lost his power in time, and
went away to Harbin.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>We also called upon the head of the civil government,
or who would have been the head of the civil
government of the province had there been any civil
government&mdash;a Mr. Tashkin, who at one time was
a member of the Duma. He proved to be a typical
Russian statesman, including whiskers and glasses.
His keen eyes impressed me as being able to see and
understand many things, and I felt that he was only
biding his time till certain military autocracies could
be pushed into the background. He is the type of
man upon which Russia will have to depend for
statesmanship, when it gives up government by the
sword.</p>

<p>Oba, Semenoff, Tashkin&mdash;to me, those three symbolized
the situation in Siberia. Oba, to a certain
extent, with the power of the Japanese Empire behind
him, stood behind Semenoff; Semenoff was at
outs with Kolchak, who in Omsk proclaimed himself
the Supreme Ruler of Russia; Semenoff had fought
the Bolshevists with his little army while Kolchak
remained inactive in Harbin; Kolchak, the way
cleared by Semenoff&#8217;s army, jumped ahead of Semenoff
to Omsk and became the chief of all Russia in
theory; Semenoff, ambitious to set himself up as a
local prince if not ambitious to be the dictator of all
Russia, resented being called upon to subordinate
himself to Kolchak and have his wings clipped.</p>

<p>Kalmikoff, being a Cossack, stood with Semenoff
so far as he dared, he in turn backed by Oi, the
Japanese commander at Khabarovsk. The United
States stood aloof, merely pleading that all parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
come to agreement. Tashkin remained quiet in the
background, holding the thin thread of his civil
power.</p>

<p>Semenoff was charged by Kolchak with treason,
and blocking the railroad and cutting the wires near
Chita. Semenoff denied the charges, and some of his
own supply trains were held up near Harbin by
General Horvat, head of the Chinese Eastern section
of the Trans-Siberian. Horvat is said to have
taken that action to aid Kolchak in forcing Semenoff
to put his army and himself under the orders of Kolchak.
In the meantime, while these forces should
have combined and been whipping the Bolshevists,
the latter were gaining strength and cutting Russia&#8217;s
throat.</p>

<p>My chief dined with a Russian family the night
he left and expected his train to arrive about ten
o&#8217;clock. His interpreter went to the station and
learned that the train would be in about seven. So
we sent hasty word to the colonel, and he left the
dinner and hastened to the station. We pried our
way into the usual crowd of refugees and sat on the
colonel&#8217;s baggage in the evil-smelling restaurant.</p>

<p>Seven o&#8217;clock came, but no train. Inquiry resulted
in the information that it would be there &#8220;Sichass,&#8221;
or presently. The train came at two the next morning.
It was stuffed to suffocation, as usual. The
station commandant fought his way into a second-class
car, found a compartment with accommodations
for four persons which held eight, and routed them
all out. The passage in the car was so jammed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
with people that we had difficulty in getting in, and
had to pass the baggage over the heads of the crowd.
And the eight who had been evicted, together with
their food and cooking utensils, stood around and
cursed the commandant.</p>

<p>In order to reach the train, we had to first climb
over ice-covered freight cars, which stood between
the passenger train and platform. The night was
dark, the tracks were coated with ice, and everything
was slippery. But we managed to transfer all the
colonel&#8217;s belongings, and left him with a guttering
candle in his compartment. A Chinese colonel and
his interpreter were put in with him, and the train
pulled out for Vladivostok. Werkstein and I went
back to our hotel, and to bed. We represented the
United States in Chita. The next morning two of
Semenoff&#8217;s officers were found assassinated in the
streets&mdash;their backs had been blown out in the
frozen fog of the night before.</p>

<small>ATAMAN SEMENOFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be remembered by the reader that the officer
whom I relieved at Chita, feared assassination.
I have no reason to believe that he did not have
good grounds for his fears. Naturally, I assumed
that I was taking over his dangers, when I took his
post. And despite the presence of Semenoff&#8217;s
army, and his armored train in the railroad yards,
there was a feeling of uneasiness in the city. Sentries
were posted in the centers of the streets, and kept
their little fires burning every night. There were
rumors every day that the Bolshevists in the city
were about to rise and slay, or that Bolshevist bands
were going to swoop down upon us from some other
city, and complete the destruction they had begun
before Semenoff drove them away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_158a"><img src="images/i_158a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ATAMAN SEMENOFF, CHIEF OF THE TRANS-BAIKAL COSSACKS</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_158b"><img src="images/i_158b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">MONGOL AND TARTAR DESCENDANTS OF CONQUERING<br /> HORDES WITH
1919 MODEL &#8220;CARS&#8221;</p>

<p>And the fact that the man who threw the bomb at
Semenoff in the theatre was a private in one of the
Ataman&#8217;s infantry regiments, kept the officers on the
alert. The bomb-thrower, who said his name was
Bernbaum, was reported to have confessed coming
from Irkutsk where he had drawn the number which
delegated to him the killing of the Ataman. He asserted
that he had been instructed by the &#8220;Maximalists&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
or Bolshevists, to go to Chita and join Semenoff&#8217;s
army, and wait his chance to kill. His bomb
killed a woman in the Ataman&#8217;s box, and wounded
several men, the Ataman suffering several wounds
from bits of the bomb.</p>

<p>There were stories of mutinies among Semenoff&#8217;s
troops, and there were whisperings that all of Semenoff&#8217;s
officers were not loyal. Most of his men
were mercenaries anyhow, and the bulk of his forces
was made up of Mongols, Buriats, some Russians
who were truly anti-Bolshevist, and many who had
wisely attached themselves to an organization which
gave food, clothing and shelter in exchange for carrying
a rifle and doing guard duty.</p>

<p>When the bomb was thrown from the gallery,
one of Semenoff&#8217;s officers jumped up and cried: &#8220;I
will have everybody in the gallery shot, if you will
give the order, Ataman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, we must not do that!&#8221; replied the
stricken Ataman. But there were many arrests, and
shortly afterward there were several executions.
Later, the actual bomb-thrower was arrested while
escaping toward Blagoveschensk. I never learned
his fate, but heard that he had given several names
to the Ataman&#8217;s officers, and that the men mentioned
were not far from Chita. I suspect that on one of
the nights I was being banqueted, there was a shooting
party.</p>

<p>I had sent word to the staff that when the Ataman
had recovered, I wished to pay a formal call. We
had not recognized Semenoff as an official governmental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
head, yet we did make calls on him, just as
we talked with anybody who could give us an inkling
as to what was going on. Instructions were in general
to meet everybody on a friendly basis, but to
take no sides.</p>

<p>One evening I got word that the Ataman would
see me. I set out for his residence with a Russian
civilian agent, who had come from Manila with the
expedition. His name was Nicholas Romanoff, a
name which amused many of the Cossack officers.</p>

<p>But Mr. Romanoff knew the Ataman intimately,
and Mr. Romanoff kindly suggested to me the things
I should say to the Ataman, just as no doubt he suggested
to the Ataman what the Ataman should say
to me. This state of affairs indicates to some extent
the ease and ability of American officers getting an
absolute American viewpoint on Russian affairs, and
the Russian and Cossack officers being able to understand
fully the American attitude.</p>

<p>I considered it about as satisfactory a proceeding,
for Russian and American interests, as getting a kiss
through a plate-glass window. I imagine that the
interpreters got satisfaction, for they were automatically
turned into diplomats, and controlled both
sides. And the power granted them, made it possible
for them to reflect the point of view from which they
might acquire for themselves the most prestige. But
in the case of Mr. Romanoff, there was every evidence
that he displayed discretion and tact. He was
the personal interpreter of the Chief of Intelligence,
who had brought him to Siberia from Manila. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
Mr. Romanoff had known Siberia well before he had
changed it as a place of residence, for the Philippines.</p>

<p>At that season of the year we lost the sun about
four thirty in the afternoon, and it was getting quite
dark as we approached the Ataman&#8217;s residence. We
were halted by the sentry, and on explaining our mission,
were admitted to the hall. Here we were met
by officers of the Ataman&#8217;s personal staff, and after
the usual bowing, and heel-clicking, left our furs,
and were ushered into a large drawing-room. The
room was richly and tastefully furnished. The
high-posted walls were hung with splendid tapestries,
and the floor beautifully carpeted.</p>

<p>There were a few pieces of black furniture, which
appeared to be of the ornately-carven Chinese
variety. The whole effect was more oriental than
Cossack, though of course the real Cossack is probably
more oriental than anything else. And, in fact,
I had heard that Semenoff was more of a Mongolian
than a Cossack, being according to report, a Prince
of Van. The only place of which I know named
Van is in European Turkey, though there may be a
Van in Mongolia.</p>

<p>The Ataman entered, on crutches. I saw a stockily-built
man, of medium height, wearing Prussian
blue trousers rather small at the bottoms of the legs,
suggestive of being habitually worn with boots. He
had on slippers. His face was heavily-jowled, very
dark, his chin chubbily-protuberant in the Rubens
style. He wore heavy drooping black mustaches, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
black eyes keen and somewhat suspicious, his hair
suggestive of scantness on top, and a Napoleonic
lock down over his low, broad forehead.</p>

<p>His photographs were always made so as to bring
out his Napoleonic points, which I had heard he
prided himself upon. He was credited with carrying
a book in his pocket which told how Napoleon acted
in every situation which required a decision, and that
when he had to decide anything, he first consulted
the book. Evidently my visit brought up no point
which required a Napoleonic decision&mdash;at least, I
did not see him consult the book while I was there.</p>

<p>I was bowed to a chair, and the Ataman let himself
down gently on a couch. He seemed a trifle
worried, but he may have been oppressed by pain.
He had only recently induced the banks of Chita to
loan him several million rubles to pay off his army&mdash;and
a local banker had called on me that day. After
we had talked a little, and I had told the Ataman
that I had heard of his ability as an organizer and
leader of armies, and of his prowess in battle, he appeared
relieved, and pulled the lock on his forehead
down a bit more.</p>

<p>The lady who presided over his Chita household
came in. The slight view I took of her as I rose
and bowed, leaves me no recollections. Even had I
desired to be courteous to a woman in her position,
discretion counselled as little notice as possible.</p>

<p>I had heard that more than one Russian officer
with an admiring eye for &#8220;wives&#8221; of other officers,
had been picked up dead in the streets. A sharp look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
from the Ataman, and the hostess did not linger. I
remember that she did not have on the pearl necklace
for which the Ataman was said to have paid
several hundred thousand rubles in Harbin, at a time
when he was short of money for his troops. His
domestic r&eacute;gime was reputed to cost him as much for
upkeep as his army. Perhaps, after all, I was not
introduced to the lady who got the pearls.</p>

<p>I had a cigar, and we talked of safe trifles. I was
there some twenty minutes. And as we passed
through the line of sentries about the Ataman&#8217;s palace-like
mansion, into the cold crisp air, I saw on the
plain below, thousands of lights burning in rude log
huts. It was all so typical of Asia&mdash;few palaces and
many huts. One man, with an army at his back,
&#8220;borrowing&#8221; from the banks to cast pearl before
swine. What better conditions to breed Bolshevism?
But the same conditions exist among the leaders of
the Bolshevists, who merely play the mobs against
the military exploiters of the people, to get control
of the banks and the money, and to have wealth for
spending in the same style. Thus the ignorance of
the people prevent them from escaping exploitation
in some form or another. We of the United States
think that it will be settled by waiting for the people
to organize themselves, so that they may express
their will. It is a case of waiting till new generations
have been educated.</p>

<p>People have said to me: &#8220;There maybe disorder
now in Siberia, but I believe that the common people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
know what they are doing, and will do what they
want to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>They know what they are doing in the same style
that the country yokel at home knows what he is
doing when he goes to New York and buys at bargain
prices several lots in Central Park. The difference
between what he is doing, and what he
thinks he is doing, costs him dearly. The Bolshevists
the world over are in the hands of a crafty lot of
confidence men.</p>

<small>FAMINE IN CHITA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> had been much discussion at home in the
newspapers about famine in Siberia, and in Vladivostok
this fear of famine was uppermost in the minds
of diplomats, military chiefs, and civilian relief
agencies. In fact, there was every evidence in Vladivostok
that the inland cities of Siberia were already
suffering from hunger, and with a severe winter
ahead, there was much apprehension for the country
people.</p>

<p>The refugees pouring into Vladivostok, clamoring
for food, depicted a state of starvation in the towns
from which they had come. And data on food-prices
gleaned from refugees and the inland press, as well
as reports by travellers, all combined to strengthen
the belief that famine faced the whole country.</p>

<p>And my first meals in Chita made me suspect that
there was much truth in the reports that Mother
Hubbardsky&#8217;s cupboard was bare. I went to dinner
with my chief the first evening in the city. We
sought the best restaurant and scanned its menu with
care; and after considerable pains we were able to
order a meal&mdash;a modest one&mdash;at a cost of about
twelve rubles each. Our rubles had cost us a dollar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
for eight in Vladivostok. So our dinner amounted to
a dollar and a half each. Then we spied four
scrawny, spotted little apples pyramided on a plate
on the counter. We ordered them, ate them, and
asked for our bill. The apples alone had cost us
thirty-six rubles&mdash;or a dollar and twelve cents each!</p>

<p>An officer has to pay for his own food. In Vladivostok
at the officers&#8217; mess, three meals a day cost a
dollar and a quarter. In Chita, six dollars a day,
without apples, was the prospect ahead. My orderly
was allowed a dollar and a quarter a day for his
subsistence. With that, he could buy exactly one
poor meal. The situation was rapidly losing its
humorous aspect. After all, was Vladivostok right
about that famine? Yet all along the line I had
seen an abundance of food for people who seemed
to be eating all the time. Evidently there was a
wrench in the machinery somewhere. It was a case
of &#8220;Who&#8217;s looney now?&#8221;</p>

<p>We stocked up immediately with rye bread, cheese
and dried fish&mdash;all purchased, the orderly said, from
peasant women near the station. The faithful Werkstein
had brought with him a little sugar, some tea,
chocolate in bars, and a few cans of army beef. He
turned my wardrobe in the hotel room into a pantry;
and with a samovar from the kitchen, prepared my
meals. It was well below freezing in the room, and
I usually wore my furs. There were forests all
around the city. But no one could be hired to cut
wood. Was not everybody free? (How I wished
that our Congress would ship me a consignment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
those parlor Bolshevists who were in the United
States preaching the beauties of Bolshevism!)</p>

<p>One evening, some of Semenoff&#8217;s officers asked
me to go to their garrison mess. &#8220;A little Russian
supper,&#8221; they explained rather apologetically. The
supper began at nine. We sat down at a tremendous
table covered with dishes, and glasses in groups.
There was a startling array of bottles. Presently a
delicious soup was served. Then came soldier-servants
bearing great salvers on which were fishes the
size of young whales&mdash;decorated with fantastically
carved vegetables. Next arrived coveys of quail and
partridge. Viands strange and barbaric followed&mdash;dishes
that suggested China and Arabia, others of
Cossack origin. O shade of Lucullus! O Herbert
Hoover!</p>

<p>The Cossack band in an adjoining room played
national airs. The different kinds of glasses were
emptied in as many toasts. And to my great relief,
the speeches began. I say relief, because naturally,
I thought the meal was over. Not so. Still the
heaped salvers came. By now, I had reached the
point where I could only weakly pretend to eat. My
hosts watched me like hawks, insisting that I rally
my appetite. They showed irritation when I demurred
faintly. They demanded that I eat and drink to
prove the unlimited friendship of the United States
for Russia. And I wondered how our diplomats had
ever survived the hospitality of such a country.</p>

<p>At last I saw that my only hopes lay in a limit to
the Cossack capacity. Again and again, I told myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
&#8220;They have reached it!&#8221;&mdash;only to realize that
what I had suffered was but a prelude to the feast.</p>

<p>At about three in the morning, the vodka and
wines having been exhausted, champagne was served&mdash;in
large, stein-like glasses. And a British officer
who had just come to observe conditions, was
startled when Irish porter showed up in stone jars.
&#8220;Why!&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;We don&#8217;t have this at home
any more! In England it&#8217;s a fond memory. And
here they have it by the case!&#8221;</p>

<p>A little supper! And there was one such about
every night. I had come looking for famine: I began
to fear I would die of over eating. One could be
forgiven a chuckle. The staff in Vladivostok had
expressed some remorse over having to send me
away from a mess which boasted three courses and
a choice of two canned fruits for dessert!</p>

<p>But what about the proletariat of Chita? These
officers were eating, but were the poor starving to
death in cold weather? I visited the open-air free
market in a square of the city. The peasants were
selling cabbage, dried salmon, salmon-roe, spheres
of cheese, rye and white bread in tremendous loaves,
quail, partridge, pheasant, beef, pork, sausage,
frozen milk and frozen soup&mdash;precisely the things I
had eaten at the &#8220;little supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>The prices ran high. But&mdash;the people had plenty
of Bolshevist money. However, this money was
greatly depreciated in value. Nevertheless, the vendors
at the market expected as many of my Imperial
rubles for any purchase as they asked the residents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of the city, who, of course, had local currency. So
now I understood that the apple which I had bought
in the restaurant at a dollar and twelve cents (or
nine Imperial roubles), would, at nine roubles Bolshevist
money, have cost a resident of Chita, only
about ten cents. What had happened to me, can best
be expressed in this wise: A man takes silver dollars
to a city where disks have been stamped &#8220;One dollar,&#8221;
and where the merchants do not care whether
he gives them tin or silver&mdash;the price is the same!
So the apples were not high; the explanation is that
money was plentiful and cheap. And now I understood
why Vladivostok was worrying over interior
statistics. The department heads mistook high costs
reported in Bolshevist rubles, for lack of food.</p>

<p>But those statistics related mainly to sugar, tea,
salt, candles and other staples, commonly regarded
as necessities, but turned by the speculators into luxuries.
Most of the Siberian speculators are of the
pack-peddler variety, because freight shipments are
costly, and the goods liable to loss. One Chita shipper
paid seventy-five thousand rubles for a car in
Harbin to move sugar to the Trans-Baikal. The
engineer got one thousand rubles to haul it; the conductor
of the train got one thousand rubles to insure
the car&#8217;s being cut off at Chita; and I heard that the
side-track was rented to the shipper while the car was
being unloaded. He assured me that he had
doubled his money in spite of paying so much
&#8220;grease.&#8221; But the railroad men, who are opposed to
&#8220;Exploitation of the masses,&#8221; thought they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
making the capitalistic speculator pay the &#8220;grease!&#8221;
Those railroad men had not been paid for six
months, and some of us Allied officers worried about
it, and gave the crews credit for staunch loyalty to
the Russian cause by sticking to their jobs. Also, a
large Red Cross train went up the line and presented
these poor, starving magnates who ran the trains,
with new clothing!</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a Russian serving Semenoff, invited
me to his room in the hotel for tea. His wife
brought from the wardrobe baskets of cookies and
candies. Trunks disgorged tinned fish, bar chocolate
and tinned milk. In one corner of the room was a
sack of sugar; in another were sacks of flour. Those
living quarters resembled a corner in the warehouse
of a wholesale grocer. And everybody was stocked
up like that. Moreover, they all had orders with the
local dealers to send them more provisions whenever
more arrived. It was a case of everybody his own
grocer. I had found the Chita stores bare. No
wonder.</p>

<p>I never saw any famine in Siberia. In fact, the
only place that I heard it discussed was in Vladivostok.
There, the flocks of refugees, seeking free
food and shelter, were responsible for the belief in
it. No doubt many of them did need aid&mdash;especially
the women and children. And in the handling of
those needy, our Red Cross did gallant service. But
among the refugees were hundreds of able-bodied
men who found it pleasant to be refugees. These
men were not likely to report that the districts from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
which they came were plentifully supplied with food.
And as these men kept pouring in from all parts of
the country, a consolidation of their reports presented
a false picture of conditions.</p>

<p>What I looked for in the interior of Siberia, contrasted
with what I found, was happily, if ridiculously,
disappointing. But in 1920 a similar hunt
might result less humorously. To feed men stops
their work; to stop work stops production. And lack
of production spells future need. So next year,&mdash;who
knows?&mdash;it may be possible to find famine in Siberia&mdash;if
meanwhile the people of that country consume
their total reserves on the strength of our promise
of generous aid. In my humble opinion, the United
States should avoid, in Siberia, all Christmas-Tree
talk.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br />


<small>NEW YEAR WITH THE JAPANESE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">New</span> Year&#8217;s Day, 1919, began for me at fifteen
minutes after midnight, with a thunderous knocking
at the glass door of my room. This was rather disconcerting,
for there had been rumors the night before
that the Bolshevists were going to rise in the
city, and slay. The glass door, with its colored paper
stuck in the panes, was not ideal for siege purposes;
but it had certain advantages, in that I could shoot
through it while the Bolshevists were breaking it in.</p>

<p>I got out of bed without making any reply to the
summons. I had opened the tiny trap-door in the
wall which served as a ventilator, and the room was
well chilled, for there was no heat in the radiators.
It was about fifty below zero outside&mdash;and about the
same inside.</p>

<p>Turning on the electric drop-light at my desk, I
put on my purple dressing-gown, and slipped my
automatic into its pocket. Then I unlocked and
threw open the door, stepping discreetly to one side,
a habit one soon acquires in a country so free and
equal as Siberia.</p>

<p>The hall was quite dark. I made out a figure close
at hand, and in the light from my electric lamp I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
caught the gleam of gold shoulder straps. A Russian
officer clicked his heels, bowed, and spoke my
name in good English.</p>

<p>I bade him enter, supposing he was an officer sent
by the Ataman. But he had just reached Chita by
special train from Omsk, and was bound for Vladivostok.
He came to tell me of a Bolshevist uprising
in Omsk, some ten days before, which had been put
down. Many Bolshevist prisoners released from the
prisons by their friends outside, had been shot.</p>

<p>This news did not surprise me at the time. I had
been told three weeks before that the Bolshevists
would rise in Omsk on that very date, release the
prisoners, and attack the Kolchak garrison. I made
an effort to recall who had foretold the uprising,
and remembered a drosky-driver who spoke English
with whom I had drunk tea in a station down the
line. On the supposition that he was merely boasting
for my benefit when he claimed to be closely in touch
with the Bolshevists, I had let the story pass as idle
talk, for if one attempted to report all rumors, a
dozen secretaries would be required by every officer
in the country. But now I realized that the drosky-driver
was in reality in the confidence of the Bolshevist
leaders at Omsk, several thousand versts
away. He had foretold the exact date of the uprising
now reported to me.</p>

<p>My Russian officer&#8217;s train had encountered Bolshevists
at two stations, and from the second his
train had been run back for the purpose of reinforcing
his guard. When he ran down the line again to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
where his progress had been opposed, he got
through without difficulty, for in the meantime the
Bolshevists had been driven away.</p>

<p>Having warned me of these facts, he was obliged
to hasten back to his train. With a click and a handshake
he was away, and I went back to bed, not quite
sure I had not dreamed a chapter from a book with
a Prisoner of Zenda flavor.</p>

<p>I shivered myself to sleep, having been chilled to
the bone while I listened to the adventures of the
Russian officer, and carried on, as the British say,
till Werkstein came thumping at my door at eight
to tell me that I must hurry to catch a train for a
New Year&#8217;s celebration at a station some sixty versts
away, where some of Semenoff&#8217;s garrison was to
make merry. Of course, it was thirteen days before
the Russian New Year, but the Cossack never misses
an excuse to celebrate anything.</p>

<p>I found myself with a violent headache, due to
having taken cold while sitting directly under the
ventilating trap, which I had forgotten to close
while I talked with the Russian officer. Doubtless
his haste to get back to his train was induced by the
terribly cold air flowing into my room, but he had
been too polite to call my attention to the open trap.
He must have thought me most inhospitable.</p>

<p>The prospect of going away to a celebration was
not alluring as I looked out the window and saw
Chita almost completely hidden by a frozen fog.
It was nearly sixty below zero, and rapidly getting
colder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Werkstein ordered the samovar, and I had tea in
bed. I do not wonder that the Russians drink so
much tea. We drank it all the time in Chita, and my
ordinary day&#8217;s tea-drinking ran as high as thirty hot
glasses. The effect was not good on my nerves, and
I discovered that I had become garrulous. Tea and
much talk go together, which is why the Russian
produces conversation in great quantities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;,</span> the missionary Y. M. C. A. man, came
to kindly offer his services as an interpreter in case
I would go to General Oba&#8217;s reception at his headquarters
at eleven. I am afraid that Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> suspected
the towel the faithful Werkstein had insisted
on putting about my head, but he was too broad-minded
a gentleman to hint at his suspicions.</p>

<p>The Oba reception lured me. It was but a couple
of blocks away, and if I still felt badly when I got
there, could leave and return to bed. So I got up and
shaved, and dug out a white shirt. After all, a white
shirt is a wonderful thing, especially if it comes out
of a package wrapped by one&#8217;s wife on the other
side of the world, and redolent of a subtle but familiar
perfume.</p>

<p>I also decided to discard temporarily the tremendous
boots I had been wearing, and got out my
dress boots and spurs, considering them the only
fitting footwear with a white shirt and stock. Besides,
a soldier on a diplomatic mission cuts rather a
sorry figure unless he can produce the proper metallic
click with his heels.</p>

<p>So away with Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> to General Oba&#8217;s. Japanese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
sentries at the door of the former department
store, wearing bands over their noses to keep them
from freezing, came to the present arms smartly. We
went up the stairs and strode down a long hall. Little
staff officers, smart as paint and most affable, took
our cards, and spoke in Russian to Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> who
startled and delighted them by responding in their
own language.</p>

<p>A bevy of Japanese orderlies abased themselves
and took our heavy coats. The Japanese machine
moves with noiseless precision, and without any
waste motions&mdash;one, our garments; two, bows and
clicks; three, this door, please.</p>

<p>The door opens. Oba stands just inside, smiling
a welcome. Clicks, bows, handshakes. The season&#8217;s
greetings. We enter. The room is decorated with
wistaria vines and Japanese dwarf trees. At a long
table running down the center of the room, and
laden with bottles and food, Japanese and Cossack
officers are standing talking in various languages and
eating and drinking.</p>

<p>A Buddhist priest, chaplain to Oba&#8217;s forces, wearing
a conventional frock coat, with an embroidered
stole-like green and gold collar thrown over his
shoulders, addresses me in English, and tells me that
he lived seven years in Vancouver. He says I must
have a potion of saki from a lacquered saucer, presented
by a Japanese soldier. The liquor is poured
from a vase-like china bottle. The Japanese custom,
I am informed. As I move down the table after
drinking the saki, bowing deeply the while, everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
clicks and bows. I meet another priest, who
does not speak English. Mr. <span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> informs me that
he is the head of another Buddhist sect, and kind of
an hereditary pope.</p>

<p>A Russian doctor, wearing mufti, but displaying a
couple of orders of the old Russian r&eacute;gime, tries me
in German, then Italian. We get on quite well for a
time, when he breaks into English&mdash;&#8220;My son&mdash;four
years Yokohama in school&mdash;she talks very good
English&mdash;one, two, three, four years. I study English
two months.&#8221; I congratulate him on his ability
in English after such a short period of study.</p>

<p>Japanese captains come smiling, to inform me that
they do not speak English, whereupon they proceed
to do so with amazing facility. It is the Japanese
custom to deprecate their own accomplishments.</p>

<p>I am urged to drink a glass of vodka with a Cossack
officer, and at the same time a Japanese officer
asserts that he will be overjoyed if I will drink with
him a thimble full of saki. Another Japanese comes
with a bottle of brandy and holds out a glass for
me, and on the other side of the table a Japanese
holds up a bottle of French wine and informs me
joyously that it is &#8220;White Wine,&#8221; and that I must
have some with him. While this is going on a Japanese
soldier, egged on by the Buddhist priest, is
pouring me a glass of Sapporo beer because I have
mentioned the fact that I was once in Sapporo,
Japan. I now have a half circle of filled glasses
before me, and in order to avoid drinking them all
at once, profess great interest in a dish on the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
which appears to be filled with raw shark, the skin
still on the pieces.</p>

<p>The Vancouver priest tells me it does not taste
good, and makes a grimace, but he says I must eat
it, for it is Japanese custom. I do so, while all my
friends who have poured out liquors for me, wait
patiently for me to consume the contents of the
various glasses. I have visions of myself carried
back to my hotel on a board, and wonder how diplomats
ever attain long lives.</p>

<p>The Russian doctor catches my eye across the
table once more. He goes around the flank in great
excitement, grasps the arm with which I am feeding
myself raw shark, and informs me in stentorian
tones: &#8220;My son&mdash;four years Yokohama&mdash;she
speaks very good English. I study two months.&#8221; I
swallow the shark and congratulate him.</p>

<p>My eye roves. It cannot evade the semi-circle of
friendly eyes which wait like wolves ready to attack,
in case I do not drink from the glasses before me. I
take a sip from each glass, bowing deeply each time
I pretend to drink. I feel that while I may not be a
brilliant success as a diplomat, I have unsuspected
possibilities as an acrobat. I discovered muscles in
my back which I never knew before that I had&mdash;and
they were getting tired. Everybody bows in triumph
as I sip from the last glass, and I am sure that the
mixture of liquors I have absorbed has poisoned me&mdash;if
it has not, the shark will!</p>

<p>Once more the polyglot conversation is resumed.
I eat chestnuts from a plate, and note the orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
and decorations worn by Russian and Japanese officers&mdash;colorful
insignia gained some fourteen years
before on the millet plains of Manchuria, not so
far away from Chita. I think of the legions of dead
burned like cord-wood, or buried in trenches, of Nogi
and his sacrificial battalions before Port Arthur.
And Nanshan and 304 Metre Hill, and the Baltic
fleet fathoms deep in the sea of Japan&mdash;the Czar,
whose stupid stubborness led to that stupid war&mdash;I
wonder if he is really dead in a well.</p>

<p>General Oba comes to me. He speaks appreciatively
of the way in which the United States &#8220;managed&#8221;
the war with Germany. I reply through Mr.
<span class="nobr">S&mdash;&mdash;</span> that the Allies appreciated what Japan did
for them in China and the Pacific. I am a bit taken
aback at being thanked for winning the war, but I
suppose I represent the United States, and must not
take the splendid compliments too seriously.</p>

<p>I wish General Oba a happy New Year, and great
prosperity for his nation. My group of friends dispersed
discreetly when Oba approached. He takes
me to the other end of the room to explain some of
the things he has there for the New Year festival.
The knot of rice straw on the wall with white strips
of paper hanging from it, is a Shinto symbol, and a
prayer for good crops.</p>

<p>On the little table before it is a pyramid of fruits,
shrine-like with two larger rice cakes upon the pyramid&mdash;an
offering to the gods who make the rice
grow. On them lies a strip of fishes skin, symbolical,
if my memory serves me right, of plenty. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
word for plenty and the word for joy are nearly the
same, the skin makes a pun. The Japanese are fond
of puns, and play upon words. Rampant against
the pile of food stuff is a red lobster, symbolical of
agility, and on top of all, two Japanese oranges
which make another pun.</p>

<p>Then we went to the door letting in from the hall,
and outside, where Oba explained the pine tree,
bamboo poles tied along its hole, and the blooming
plum shrub at the base of the tree. General Oba
says: &#8220;This bamboo signifies that a man&#8217;s character
must be upright, the tree signifies long life, for
the pine grows to great age, and as the plum bush
blooms early, coming to flower despite the cold of
early spring, it stands for perseverance in the face
of adversity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Japan is a land of beautiful symbols. These
stands of triple symbols are shown before every
home in Japan on New Year&#8217;s Day.</p>

<p>We return to the guest table, and I thank Oba
for his kindness in explaining the various decorations.
We have a thimble of <i>saki</i>, and bow. He
turns to speak to a Cossack officer, and the smiling
little Buddhist priest with the green stole comes to
chat with me again. Once more the Russian doctor
comes to tell me of his son in Yokohama and
how well he speaks English. He drags me to a
great Japanese map of Russia on the wall and shows
me how close Japan is, and then with an all-embracing
sweep of his hand, informs me that America is
far away across the Pacific. I agree.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>A Japanese officer looks at the map, and comparing
the size of Russia with the little island Empire
of Japan, observes whimsically that Japan is very
small. I tell him that greatness is not always measured
by size, and wonder if in an effort to be polite to
Japan I have not given Russia a left-handed compliment.
But the Japanese bows and hisses, evidently
well pleased.</p>

<p>Cossack officers with great swinging sabers, more
like scimitars than anything else, come and shake
hands with me solemnly, and rattle their spurs. Once
more the Buddhist priest takes me in tow and swears
I must drink one more drop of saki with him if the
cordial relations between Japan and the United
States are to be preserved. We preserve the cordial
relations between the two countries, and the
thought of myself on a board recurs&mdash;I begin to fear
that the Russian doctor across the table, now regarding
me with serious mien, is about to dash around
the table again and tell me once more about his son
in Japan.</p>

<p>I decided that it is time to go, and spying Oba
near the door, I work my way toward him, and when
he is disengaged, come to attention with my loudest
click. We bow and shake hands. I step backward
four paces, about face, and find myself in the hall.
Staff officers come forward in a rush and make a
great ceremony of my coat and furs, and I go down
the hall amid a perfect orgy of bows, while the bayonets
of sentries in the long hall shoot upward at
the present, to do me honor. I plunge out into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
frigid air. East and West have met, and I like General
Oba and his staff.</p>

<p>When I returned to my room, I got word that
General Knox of the British Indian army was in his
train at the station. I went down to call. His train
had arrived from Vladivostok, and he was on his
way to Omsk. I found a group of British officers in
splendid first-class coaches, and palatial dining-car.
They fairly hustled me into that dining-car, and on
came the tea and jam and cakes.</p>

<p>Colonels, majors, and captains wearing service
stripes which proclaimed the fact that they had been
in the war a long time, sat round and talked. I noted
many of the red chevrons which marked their wearers
as members of the gallant old &#8220;Contemptibles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Britain never loses a chance to turn a slur into an
honor, and every officer and man who was at the
front or on the way over seas to fight for the motherland
at the time that the Kaiser referred to England&#8217;s
&#8220;contemptible little army&#8221; gets the red
chevron on his sleeve which allows him to call himself
a &#8220;contemptible.&#8221; Those are the little things
on which a great nation is built.</p>

<p>These officers were as jolly and unassuming as a
lot of school boys. I like the way in which the British
can, at times, forget rank and put behind them
the things they have done. They decline to take
themselves seriously&mdash;yet they manage to make the
rest of the world do so.</p>

<p>Other nations take themselves seriously, and have
something in their manner that suggests with more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
or less menace that you must have the same attitude
toward them. But the British have welded an empire
out of many queer nationalities with the simple
idea that a gentleman does not have to insist that
he is a gentleman&mdash;the instant he does so he ceases
to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>I do not believe the British have always been
right, but they have been right often enough to win
my admiration. And the best any nation can do is
to try and be right all the time. Standards of conduct
for individuals and nations are always changing,
despite the assertions of many people that
&#8220;human nature cannot be changed.&#8221; Quite true, but
human nature which displays barbaric tendencies can
be controlled.</p>

<p>At one time a man had to get drunk to be a
gentleman, and he had to fight a duel if challenged,
or challenge to a duel if he suffered what he considered
insult. Human nature has not changed, but
we have changed the standards for decent human
conduct. And some day there will be no wars because
human nature is willing to meet the new
standards we shall set up. In the meantime, we cannot
end wars by throwing away our own guns and
allowing the other fellow to keep his. We must
evolute by education rather than by legislation,
though continual legislating internationally will advance
the education by providing a free interchange
of ideas and a setting up of international ideals.</p>

<p>I did not have the pleasure of paying my respects
in person to General Knox, for I think he was calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
on Ataman Semenoff. But I left my card. As I
walked back to my hotel in the Siberian twilight, I
passed a Siberian <i>moujik</i> staggering drunkenly from
the effects of vodka. And as I went on after letting
him have all the road to pass me, I philosophized in
an amateur way in this wise: What is the difference
between this Siberian <i>moujik</i> and me? Why should
I feel myself his superior? Was it anything that I
myself had done? No. The difference between me
and the drunken Siberian <i>moujik</i> lay entirely in the
fact that I had been luckier than he in my ancestors.
My progenitors established, and left to me a form
of government which meant opportunity instead of
oppression. I had begun life as a factory boy, but
not as the descendant of a line of ignorant serfs.</p>

<p>The men and women of my race who had stood
for freedom ages before I was born, were now dust
in ancient graves. They had wrested from King
John of England the Great Charter of human liberties,
and from German George the Third, freedom
for the American colonies. The <i>moujik</i> had only just
begun to think of freedom, and was making rather a
mess of the job. If his ancestors had begun to fight
for freedom a thousand years before, I would not
be in Siberia wondering what was to be done. This
was the real Siberian twilight&mdash;the twilight which
precedes the sunlight of full freedom, a twilight
which reveals queer goblins, and bizarre shapes
burning and slaying through the night which must
come and pass before dawn.</p>

<p>These musings were undoubtedly due to having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
been entertained by the kindly Oba, and then the
startling contrast of having been made to feel at
home with the hospitable British&mdash;or maybe it was
the raw shark I had eaten which made my mind
wander.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVIII<br />


<small>DIPLOMACY AND&mdash;MICE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a previous chapter I mentioned Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> a Russian serving in Semenoff&#8217;s forces, who
had his room in the Hotel Select full of food. This
officer, and his wife, a frail little woman who had
been desperately ill and was still in the convalescent
stage, became my closest friends in Chita.</p>

<p>Every afternoon at four I was in their room for
tea, and Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> who was an accomplished
musician, played Russian operas and sang. The
piano had been borrowed from the wife of a Russian
doctor living in the hotel. Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s</span> few
sheets of music were all that were left to her from
a large collection, after several encounters with Bolshevists,
in which the most of her baggage had been
stolen or confiscated. This couple had spent the
previous year in flights from various cities. They
had escaped from Odessa, from Ekaterinburg, from
Irkutsk&mdash;from countless places. And many times
they were in deadly peril.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> belonged to the old Russian aristocracy.
He had an estate in the Altai mountains,
which had been destroyed by Bolshevists, and gold
mines. He had a villa in Japan. He had travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
round the world many times, and knew Africa, for
instance, like the palm of his hand. He referred
casually to Lake Nyanza and Victoria Falls in the
same matter-of-fact way that he mentioned his visit
to Niagara Falls. He spoke nine languages. He had
been attached to the Russian Consulate in New York
for a long time. He spoke English fluently, and was
a most delightful chap. His saber-hilt had the monogram
of the Czar&mdash;he was close to the imperial
family, without doubt, though he discreetly kept off
the subject of his former associations with the court
life.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> came originally from Bessarabia,
and had lived in Moscow. She spoke French well,
and was learning English. I picked up considerable
Russian at those teas, and Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> practiced her
English on me, her husband laughing gaily at her
mistakes.</p>

<p>I remember one afternoon that the table cover
had upon it embroidered butterflies. And while Mrs.
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was serving my tea, I put my finger on one of
these butterflies, and said, &#8220;Butterfly,&#8221; for the purpose
of giving her the English of it. She looked at
her husband in consternation after giving me a
startled glance, and said something in Russian. He
was busy opening a can of jam, and looked up in
surprise at what she had said to him, for she was
on the point of tears.</p>

<p>He smiled and asked me: &#8220;What was it you just
said? I did not hear. My wife did not understand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;I said this was a butterfly,&#8221; I replied, pointing
to the embroidery.</p>

<p>He dropped the can of jam and roared with
laughter, at the time patting his wife&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>It happened that the table cover was much the
worse for wear, though of fine linen.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> spoke in explanation to his wife,
and she too laughed, and began to chatter merrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife could not understand why you should
mention the fact that the table cover is very old and
no good,&#8221; said Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> &#8220;The Russian word
&#8216;butterclou&#8217; means trashy, old and worn out&mdash;junk.
And she thought you were referring to the table
cloth as no good, when you put your finger on it and
said &#8216;butterfly.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I made my apologies. And then I told of the
American of our Committee on Public Information
who arrived at Harbin at two in the morning, and,
ordered the drosky-driver to take him to a hotel.
The driver looked very surprised, but he drove
away with the American, and they rolled through
most of the streets of Harbin, up and down and
all around for an hour.</p>

<p>The American noticed that the driver peered in at
shop windows, and was in the mercantile part of the
city, especially among the Chinese shops. He demanded
in exasperation why the driver could not
find a hotel, but all the poor driver could do was
scratch his head and protest that he was doing his
best.</p>

<p>Finally, they found somebody who could translate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
and discovered that the American had not asked
for a &#8220;gasteenitsah,&#8221; or hotel, but had told the
driver that he wished some mustard, the Russian
word for mustard being quite similar to the Russian
word for hotel. The driver had been trying to find
a grocery store open at that early hour.</p>

<p>This inability to grasp the meaning of a sentence
from the circumstances despite a slight mispronunciation
of the vital word in the sentence, I found to
be typical among most Russians. Every word must
be pronounced accurately, or the Russian is completely
at sea for your meaning.</p>

<p>For several weeks I shocked waiters and waitresses
in restaurants by asking for cakes with my tea.
They regarded me with distrustful eyes, and plainly
disapproved of me. I could not understand why when
I asked for a provodnik with my tea, I never got
one, but did get a frightened look.</p>

<p>The explanation is that the attendants were taken
aback at the discovery that Americans are cannibals,
despite all reports to the contrary. For a provodnik
is not a cake, but the man who looks after the fires in
a passenger car, and pretends to sweep the floor
when you want to sleep. Naturally, they did not
serve me a provodnik&mdash;neither did they give me a
cake. I got my cake by going to the counter and
pointing it out. Yet provodnik strikes me as a far
better name for cake in Russian, than the word they
use, which is proven by the fact that I can remember
provodnik now, but forget entirely the word for
cake.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>I found that the British were not nearly so
dependent upon interpreters as we were. They had
officers who spoke Russian perfectly, some of them
being Russian-born. This expert knowledge of the
language may be due in part to the fact that England
for a long time feared Russia. Some of Kipling&#8217;s
early stories of garrison life in India express this
mistrust for &#8220;the man who walks like a bear.&#8221; And,
in fact, the Siberian peasant does walk like a bear,
for his shambling gait, a great body slightly
stooped, with long powerful arms at his side, he suggests
Bruin amazingly.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was commandant of the Hotel
Select, used as quarters by Semenoff&#8217;s officers and
their families. His own room was down the hall
from mine, past the dining-room being used as an
officers&#8217; mess, with German war-prisoners as waiters.</p>

<p>I returned to my room late one afternoon, and
met Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> going out. I spoke to him, and
he scarcely replied. He had on his sheepskin coat
and Cossack cap, and I noted at once that he was
not wearing his saber. It was the first time I had
seen him without it. He looked pale. There was
another Cossack officer with him. I sensed something
wrong at once. Nicholas Romanoff, the agent
referred to before, was with me, and Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
stepped aside and said something to Romanoff in
Russian in a guarded tone, and then marched down
the hall with the Cossack.</p>

<p>Romanoff&#8217;s manner was troubled. We went into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
my room without saying a word, and locked the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is up?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> has been arrested,&#8221; he said,
sadly. &#8220;Arrested on order of the Ataman, who is
down the railroad toward Harbin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With what is he charged?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now to be arrested in Chita by order of the
Ataman, especially while the Ataman is absent, at
that time and under the prevailing conditions is no
joke; and to be arrested without being charged with
the offense for which the arrest is made, is dangerous;
and to be one of Semenoff&#8217;s officers and be arrested,
is doubly dangerous. Being arrested in such
manner is quite likely to mean being shot within an
hour. There was a good chance that while Romanoff
and I stood there looking at each other we might
hear a rifle volley.</p>

<p>It was no affair of mine. I could not prevent an
execution. I had no way of knowing what had been
discovered against Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> if anything. It
might be a private feud, it might be that Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> had entirely too many Imperial rubles of big
denominations in his trunk, as I well knew. It was
quite possible that somebody in power had taken a
fancy to Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> and decided to eliminate her
husband on a trumped up charge while the Ataman
was away. And the Ataman might or might not
have ordered the arrest&mdash;anything was possible in
Chita.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was my friend. I made up my
mind that not much time would pass before I called
upon the Ataman&#8217;s staff, to ask as diplomatically as
possible the reason for the arrest. Not that I expected
to be told the truth, but I did intend to apprise
Semenoff&#8217;s headquarters that I was aware of
what had happened. And I did intend to imply that
if an officer was executed summarily without evidence
against him which justified such action, such
summary action would be considered against Semenoff&#8217;s
sense of justice as a military administrator.</p>

<p>Semenoff or Semenoff&#8217;s officers might shoot Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> to satisfy some Cossack whim if they
wished to, but if they did so they could not expect to
have me regard them as people at all fit to exercise
control over any people or part of Siberia, or to
talk with me officially or unofficially.</p>

<p>I was determined that if Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was shot
I would know why, and if disapproved, the relations
existing between the United States and Ataman
Semenoff as represented by me, would be broken off
immediately, and that I would so report to my headquarters
and if not upheld, request my relief from
duty at Chita.</p>

<p>Knowing that Romanoff was close to the Ataman
and his staff officers, I apprised Romanoff of my attitude
very quickly, and told him to come with me to
Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>We found her in tears, and frantically dressing
for the street. She had not been out since she had
recovered from a long illness, and the weather was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
extremely cold. She said that her husband had been
arrested by order of a colonel who lived in the hotel
across the street, and that she was going over to
talk with him and demand the reason for the arrest.</p>

<p>I sent Romanoff with her, and again charged him
to unofficially inform the colonel or anybody else
concerned of my great interest in the case, and that
I would expect a proper trial in case there was a
legitimate charge against Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> In other
words, that the United States was watching, and that
while there would be no interference, Cossack methods
would be judged by this affair.</p>

<p>Romanoff and Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> were gone more than
an hour, and when they returned, Romanoff assured
me that the colonel had promised to release Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> but Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was still worried. She was
well aware of the custom of shooting people first
and making explanations afterward. Many innocent
persons suffered by this custom. When a mistake
was made, the official responsible generally shrugged
his shoulders and asked if there were not plenty
more people in the world.</p>

<p>The reason for the arrest was reported to be that
Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> had given a room in our hotel to an
officer of Semenoff, when the officer showed an order
signed by the Ataman that quarters should be provided.
There was but one room in the hotel available&mdash;a
room which had been occupied by the
colonel who had ordered Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> arrested.
This colonel had not lived in the room for weeks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
but had moved to the hotel across the street, leaving
in his room in our hotel a small grip.</p>

<p>It was charged that the order for quarters was
an old one, and that since it had been signed the officer
had had trouble with the Ataman. But Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> did not know this, and accepted the order for
quarters for what it appeared to be on its face&mdash;still
in force.</p>

<p>But the principal crime committed by Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> was said to be having allowed the officer out
of the good graces of the Ataman, to sleep in a
room while the colonel&#8217;s bag remained in a closet.
It may have been that the bag had been opened, or
it may have been that the bag contained documents
which would have caused the colonel trouble with the
Ataman. But it all appeared to me as a fine piece of
subterfuge, if the facts were as given. But one
rarely gets the facts in Siberia.</p>

<p>Romanoff and I remained with Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
through the evening, waiting. When she was not
crying dolefully and wringing her hands, she was
playing for us on her piano, stopping at times to
listen to footsteps in the hall to see if they could
be those of her husband, coming back.</p>

<p>Romanoff&#8217;s room was right across the hall, and
he stepped out for a minute, leaving the <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> door
open. While he was absent, Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> stopped
playing suddenly and listened. Then she cried out
in terror and ran into the hall. I had heard nothing
startling, and wondered what had caused her perturbation.
She ran in again presently, crying &#8220;Meescha!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Meescha!,&#8221; or so it sounded to me, and pointed
to the corner of her room, where a large sack stood.
It was a sack of sugar, and as I approached it, I
heard a rustling.</p>

<p>I looked in and saw two mice and then held the
top of the sack shut so they could not escape into the
room. Finally I dragged the sack out into the hall,
close to the open door of the officers&#8217; mess-room. It
was full of dining officers, and some of them looked
out in surprise at seeing me dragging a heavy sack
through the hall. I opened the sack and let the mice
escape. They ran into the dining-room, but as no one
had noticed them it did not matter. So I dragged
the sack back to Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;s</span> room.</p>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> came striding
down the hall. I supposed the colonel had held him
prisoner a few hours so as not to be too ready to
show any regard for my attitude. And being in Asia,
the colonel had to &#8220;save his face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> wrung my hand, and I pushed him
gently through the door to his wife. I went back to
my own room, wondering if I had prevented an execution.</p>

<small>NEW FRIENDS, PRISONS, AND OTHER THINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> British officers came to Chita to observe
conditions for their government. Lieutenant-Colonel
<span class="nobr">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> of the General Staff, Major <span class="nobr">K&mdash;&mdash;</span> of the
British Indian Army, and Captain <span class="nobr">P&mdash;&mdash;</span> who was
an expert on railroad conditions and gave his attention
to matters pertaining to the Trans-Siberian.</p>

<p>This trio made my life a joy, for they were jolly
chaps, keen on their work and keen on play when it
was time to play, as is the Briton the world over.
These gentlemen were much amused at first by my
&#8220;Americanism,&#8221; but in a short time they discovered
that my American idioms were provided chiefly for
their entertainment and they declined to take my
exaggerated slang seriously.</p>

<p>And as I spent much time in foretelling what
would happen in Siberia, they dubbed me &#8220;Old
Moore&#8221; after the ancient and celebrated prophet in
England who publishes the prophetic &#8220;Old Moore&#8217;s
Almanac.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as we got franker, they asked questions in
gentle criticism of American institutions and I in
turn told them what was wrong with England and
the British Empire. Colonel <span class="nobr">H&mdash;&mdash;</span> had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
through the United States on his way to Siberia, and
was puzzled by some of the characteristics of American
journalism, as well as startled by the hospitality
that had been accorded to him by new friends in
New York, and in the clubs of that city. Being a
lover of tennis, a New York tennis club had made
his stay in the city a delight. He was still in something
of a daze over the way in which the courts and
club-house had been turned over to him to use as
his own.</p>

<p>Major <span class="nobr">K&mdash;&mdash;</span> had with him his Indian orderly,
who spent most of his time lurking in the lower hall
of the hotel, waiting to pounce upon his officer and
demand if there was anything that could be done.
He had been with Major <span class="nobr">K&mdash;&mdash;</span> about sixteen years,
and fairly worshiped him. And it was most amusing,
and significant, that in a very short time this Hindu
was prattling Russian to the waiters and samovar
girls. He swore that the Russian language was borrowed
from his own precious Hindustani, indicating
that all Asia is linked together far closer than the
casual observer might believe.</p>

<p>And I wonder if Britain&#8217;s old fear of Russia was
not based on an understanding of the fact that India
and Russia might find it easier to coalesce into one
nation than India and England. India and Russia
have had much the same training in understanding
and submitting to a form of government headed by
a cruel and powerful emperor. They respect the
sword and scoff at the commoner who presumes to
rule too kindly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Both countries have produced large numbers of
ignorant peasants with profligate native ruling
classes. Also, both countries are filled with diversified
tribes, with climates ranging from tropical to
frigid zones, or at least with magnificent distances.
Also, both countries are very rich in natural resources,
yet in those countries the human race has
allowed itself to be most enslaved. India had her
great Moghuls, Russia has had her cruel dynasties.
And the masses of the peoples are more concerned
with their crops than with their capitals.</p>

<p>In this latter respect I have not found the Russian
peasant hard to understand. The Russian noble
and land-owner presents to me a greater problem.
Here is a country in which the people love the land&mdash;they
love to sow and reap, to dig and make the
land produce. In fact, they demand little else. Yet
the history of the Russian peasant is one of a constant
fight to use and possess the land, while the great
land-owner and the government, have persisted in
thwarting him. This insistence upon preventing the
peasants from having the land comes from the
feudal idea that the upper class must be master of
the land and master of its servitors.</p>

<p>So Russia has been ruled, and the peasant controlled,
by a monopoly of land. To allow that
monopoly to wane, as the upper class saw it, was to
lose the power of ruling, which under the old r&eacute;gime
was closely identified in Russia with taxation and
what we call graft. In order to maintain these
powers, the dynasty and its parasitic satellites, kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
the people ignorant. The result was Bolshevism&mdash;war
between those who own property and those who
have been prevented from owning property. So ignorance
has almost destroyed the upper class in Russia,
and will destroy more of the common people
than the most cruel dynasty could execute and kill
in prisons in a thousand years of ruthless reign.</p>

<p>It is necessary in considering the people of Siberia
to recall some of the facts of its history. We know
that the Czars and their agents put &#8220;dangerous people&#8221;
into cold storage in Siberia. And the thinker,
the idealist, the protesters against the government
were classed as criminals, and imprisoned with criminals.
This, curiously enough, established a bond of
fellowship between the most vicious cut-throats of
the Empire and the highest-minded men and women
it had produced.</p>

<p>If a man or woman has spent half a lifetime in a
stone cell where the temperature drops as low as
eighty degrees below zero for merely daring to think
of government, criticise it, and demand justice for
the ignorant people, that man or woman is not going
to worry about cruel methods in retaliation if freedom
ever comes. And when such a political convict
has been chained to a murderer for work, and lives
in such a cell with a murderer, these two will join
hands against the common enemy. Centuries were
spent building up such hatreds. Why should we
wonder at the cruelties practiced when the prisons
were opened?</p>

<p>I saw in Chita one of the old prisons. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
empty, with the cell doors hanging from broken
hinges&mdash;hideous doors of planks painted a dull yellow,
with small holes cut in them for passing in food,
and the edges of the holes stained black with the
grime of countless dirty hands which for unknown
years had delivered food to prisoners. I got into
this prison unexpectedly one cold day while seeking
another prison&mdash;Semenoff&#8217;s military prison. And I
wandered through it, and examined it in detail.</p>

<p>Stone benches had served as beds&mdash;two to a cell.
The remains of the sanitary appliances, if they could
be described as sanitary at all, were most crude. I
went into one of these cells and shut the door, and
sat on the stone bench. The hole in the door, six
inches square, gave scarcely any light from the corridor.
I put my flashlight on the walls, and found
them scratched on every inch with names, initials,
and dates.</p>

<p>One wall was covered with rows upon rows of
scratches in the stone. At first I thought there had
been a rude attempt at interior decoration, but the
word for &#8220;years&#8221; was dimly revealed in many places.
Every scratch represented a year spent by human
beings in that stone grave! Dark, damp, terribly
cold and full of vile odors though it was nearly a
year since the prison had been emptied of its human
misery, this cell in ten minutes told me more about
Siberia than all the historians and diplomats and
students of Russia could have told me in a lifetime
of reading or lecturing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_200a"><img src="images/i_200a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SIBERIANS CELEBRATING THE SIGNING OF THE ARMISTICE</p>

<p class="caption">ROOM IN HOUSE AT EKATERINBURG WHERE THE CZAR<br /> AND HIS FAMILY
ARE REPUTED TO HAVE BEEN EXECUTED</p>

<p>And on one of these walls, was inscribed a date
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>and this sentence: &#8220;Nicolai died last night&mdash;he
missed freedom by fourteen hours after waiting
twenty-two years,&#8221; and the date scrawled near it,
represented the date on which the prisons of Siberia
had been opened under the Kerensky r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>Just imagine waiting twenty-two years in such environment
for the overthrow of the Czar, and then
missing freedom by fourteen hours! If you had,
would you dare tell a former Siberian convict to be
more gentle in dealing with those who upheld the
system of the old r&eacute;gime? And would you be too
ready to accept somebody&#8217;s word that a new dictator
who wanted to set himself up to rule Russia would
not restore the old prison system?</p>

<p>When Washington or London or Paris is puzzled
about Russia and what course to pursue with that
country, I would like to take a group of the diplomats
to such a Siberian prison as I saw and let
them spend a single night in it with the doors
locked and not quite sure how many years it would
be before somebody bade them come out into the
light of day. I believe they would appreciate better
the doubts and suspicions of the Russian people
about government in the making.</p>

<p>I wished to make a note of what was on the wall
of that cell, but it was too cold to unbutton my coat
and get out pencil and note book. I read it over and
over&mdash;I can still see it in my mind&#8217;s eye. It was
seventy-two below zero that morning, and I was willing
enough to walk out and get into my drosky and
go about my business. And I thought of Patrick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
Henry, George Washington, John Hancock, Benjamin
Franklin and a lot of people who had done
something for human liberties&mdash;and mine.</p>

<p>Chita was the place to which the group of revolutionists
known as &#8220;The Decembrists&#8221; had been sent,
back about 1840. And an old man in Chita who had
spent years as an exile, had a collection of branding
irons and other implements of torture used on convicts
in a private museum. Among other things were
figurines of convicts made by convicts, complete in
every detail, even to the leg chains and the convict
clothing. These figurines, including the chains, had
been moulded out of convict bread!</p>

<p>And in Chita I saw &#8220;Damskaya Oolitsia,&#8221; or
&#8220;The Street of the Dames.&#8221; This consisted of two
rows of log houses near the railroad tracks, which
had been built by the wives of the Decembrist exiles
for habitations, these gentlewomen having followed
their husbands into exile and having been granted
the right to build a street for themselves.</p>

<p>These wives were not allowed to communicate
with their husbands, who were worked outside the
prisons in chain-gangs. But with that feminine ingenuity
for outwitting locksmiths when there is love
in the heart, these brave women managed to talk
with their husbands. The clever trick was accomplished
by hiring a carriage from the aborigine
Buriats of the locality, and driving past the chain-gangs.
When close to the working convicts, the
horse was made to balk. The women, pretending to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
be arguing with the driver and demanding that he
make the horse go on, shouted in French.</p>

<p>The Russian guards of course did not understand
French, but the convict-husbands did. Thus messages
of hope were transmitted, and news of what
was going on in Petrograd and Moscow in revolutionary
circles, with probably information that pardons
were being sought, was given to the exiles.</p>

<p>Many of these brave and loyal women remained
in Chita till their deaths. Most of the husbands
died in prison, and the widows went back to the
cities of Europe.</p>

<p>The new Czar came to the throne&mdash;he who was
to lose it. There is a grotto in the forests back of
Chita to commemorate his visit to the city while he
was the Crown Prince. He made the journey by
sledges, for at that time there was no railroad. He
might have learned a lot in Chita about government,
but the Second Nicholas was weak and stubborn and
would not heed even the advice of his greatest statesman,
Count Witte. And the prisons of Nicholas
the Second brought about his ruin and the ruin of
his Empire. After all, I wonder if prisons cannot
teach lessons in freedom.</p>

<p>Some men are born a thousand years too late, and
are a menace to our present civilization. Some men
are born a thousand years too soon, and having
ideals a cycle in advance of human progress, likewise
may become a menace to organized society.
But the Russian government lagged behind human
progress&mdash;even such progress as its own people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
made under governmental oppression. So the government
imprisoned thieves and murderers&mdash;what
we call criminals. But it also classed as criminals,
and rightly, nihilists and assassins who used violence
against the government. But it also classed as criminals,
and imprisoned them, men and women with
the greatest visions and the greatest spirits in the
Empire. Thinking became a crime.</p>

<p>The government&#8217;s attitude toward a Tolstoy differed
in no way from its attitude toward a crack-brained
agitator, except that it dared imprison or
execute the agitator, but only dared scowl at Tolstoy.</p>

<p>We of the United States condemned the Czar and
his government of parasites for its enmity toward
Tolstoy, not understanding that Tolstoy was not
dangerous for what he himself actually did against
the government, but for what he instigated others
to do. The ideals of a Tolstoy, carried out by assassins,
may wreck not only a criminal government, but
may topple over the whole structure of civilization
throughout the world.</p>

<p>I believe now that the Czar&#8217;s government, for all
its hideousness, understood that its revolutionists not
only threatened the imperial system but also menaced
the lives of all the people in the Empire.</p>

<p>Revolution may be necessary when evolution,
throttled by a few who control the destiny of a
people, is not permitted to operate. The aspirations
of the Russian people were beyond their abilities to
carry out. They accomplished a successful revolution.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Will they be able to hold the good they gained
by it? If not, we can only say they did not deserve
the liberty they acquired.</p>

<p>It was as dangerous in Russia under the old
r&eacute;gime to be ahead of the times as it was to be
behind them&mdash;as dangerous to be an idealist as to be
a cut-throat. The people, we knew, were ahead of
their system of government, and even the ignorant
peasants who blamed the government for all their
woes from bad crops to taxes, were theoretically
right. But it is worse to pursue a theory of government
and not to know what to do with it once you
have it, than it is to have no idealistic theories and
face conditions as they exist.</p>

<p>Columbus had a theory that by sailing to the westward
he would reach India. He discovered America.
If he had sailed to destruction over the edge of the
&#8220;flat&#8221; world, only his crews and the three ships of
his venture, would have been lost. It is quite another
matter to embark with a whole nation, or
group of nations, into unknown seas. The nation
and all it has gained by centuries of evolution, may
be lost, and the children of a few survivors be thrown
back into barbarism. That is what the idealists of
the Czar&#8217;s Empire have done, directing a vast but
ignorant population. And the people of Russia are
still waiting for a pilot who can cry &#8220;Land ho!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE SOBRANIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> city of Chita being in an unsettled condition
as the result of the Bolshevist troubles passed, and
not knowing when more similar troubles might occur,
the people never gave up for a single night
their amusements. High schools produced amateur
plays, there were masque balls, banquets, benefits,
motion pictures, and theatres. The empire lay shattered,
and foreign flags flew over their public buildings,
marking the garrisons of foreigners doing
police duty for the Siberians&mdash;they gave themselves
up to making merry.</p>

<p>And when the Siberian goes out for an evening&#8217;s
entertainment, he does not return home till the small
hours of morning. The result is that little work or
business is done the following day before noon, and
there is not much activity in business after two
o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>No matter what came up, I could not expect to
find anyone at the staff headquarters of Semenoff
before eleven o&#8217;clock. There might be a report at
daylight that a train had been attacked by Bolshevists
twenty miles away; it could not be verified before
noon. If I got a message in cipher from Vladivostok<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
at nine o&#8217;clock in the morning that Russians
had attacked Japanese troops near Chita, and asking
me to get the details, in fifteen minutes I could have
the Japanese version of the affair, but it would take
forty-eight hours to get the Russian statement of
what had happened.</p>

<p>If my telegram came over the regular Russian
wire, it might be delivered to the hotel proprietor,
who would call my attention to it the following
week. In the meantime, messages for the Czecho-Slovak
commandant, or a French correspondent of
whom I had never heard, or some British officer,
would be brought to my room at all hours of the
night. My room was a receiving station for all telegrams
which the Russian operators did not know
where to deliver&mdash;and when one came for me, it was
mis-delivered, generally.</p>

<p>My cipher messages were transmitted as numbers,
and when Russian operators received them, they
always left out thirty or forty numerals in the middle
of the message so that when it was being deciphered,
the last half of it did not decipher at all, but when
transformed into letters looked like an alphabet that
had run <i>amok</i>. I generally asked for it to be repeated
to my own signal corps operator over our
private wire, but that wire was open for us but an
hour in the forenoon and an hour in the afternoon.
So if I got a defective message over the Russian
wire five minutes after my wire was closed in the
morning, I had to wait until afternoon before I
could with any surety of getting the message through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
tell Vladivostok to repeat. And the repeated message
would not reach me till the next morning.</p>

<p>I suspect that there was a system of sabotage
being practiced on us. There was every evidence that
Semenoff&#8217;s officers in charge of the commercial telegraph
office had held up our cipher messages until
they had made an effort to decipher them. Or knowing
that they had done something which they did not
want reported or contemplated doing something,
they held up the message as long as possible. For
instance, if Semenoff had his armored train in the
station and the engines with steam up ready to move
up the line for some purpose, any message I sent
through at that time was suspected to contain the
information that his armored train was about to
move in a certain direction. So the message was
not put on the wire till the movement was completed.</p>

<p>Yet what appeared to be sabotage, or a blockade
system on information, might well be the result of
stupidity induced by late hours and too much vodka.
It was noon before the population appeared to have
a lucid interval in their existence, and having acquired
a clear head again, the chief ambition in life
immediately was to become befuddled with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>I discovered the old &#8220;Imperial&#8221; vodka being sold
on the streets, the vendors setting up in business with
an old box and a dozen bottles of the liquor. I refer
to it as Imperial because it was vodka made under
the old r&eacute;gime as revealed by the paper seals over
the corks, and the payment of imperial taxes, vodka<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
having been a government monopoly. A pint bottle
could be purchased for about twelve rubles on the
streets, the same costing forty rubles in the restaurants.</p>

<p>It was said that there were millions of rubles
worth of this vodka in storage in Chita, which had
been taken over by Semenoff, and which aided his
finances to an appreciable extent. No doubt somebody
collected a fee to allow it to be sold, and no
doubt it was sold to the dealers by the agents of
Semenoff, who had acquired it by simply taking it.
Siberians using the whole of the wide street below
my windows in order to walk past, could be seen any
minute of daylight.</p>

<p>The Russian calendar is full of holidays. One
holiday in a week, ruins the week&mdash;and the Russian
for a week. He generally starts celebrating the
day before the holiday, and uses the day after the
holiday to extend the merriment. And most weeks
while I was in Chita contained two holidays.</p>

<p>I subscribed for the local newspapers on arrival.
There were three dailies. I got about one of each
every week. Out of curiosity I made inquiries, but
there was always a good excuse&mdash;the printers had
been drunk, there had been a holiday, there was
going to be a holiday, the press was broken, or
Semenoff had confiscated the whole edition and arrested
the editor. I would not care to be a publisher
or journalist in Siberia.</p>

<p>Whether a paper came out on a certain day or
not, however, the newsboys every night cried the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
&#8220;Nash Put&#8221; (Our Way), or the &#8220;Za Baikalsky&#8221;
(Trans-Baikalist) every night. The date of the
paper might be three days old. <i>Nitchyvo.</i> The
buyer could not stop in the excessive cold to hunt
for a mere date, but bought his paper while going
ahead at a jog-trot. I never saw a native protest.
Either he had not read the paper of that date, or he
did not care. Perhaps he could not read. A Siberian
acquires a certain social standing by being seen
purchasing a paper. Anyhow, he is probably on his
way somewhere to drink vodka and will forget all
about the paper when he reaches his destination.
There was something about the Siberian buyer of
newspapers which reminded me of the young police
reporter in San Francisco who wore mauve gloves,
had a gold-headed cane and carried with him everywhere
a copy of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. He never
read it. When he wore out one copy carrying it,
he bought another. It gave him a reputation with
the public and the staff of the newspaper for being
a bright young man with considerable erudition.</p>

<p>These general statements on private and public
entertainment may make it appear that amusement
is, after all, rather haphazard in Siberia, and breaks
out in sporadic sprees. It would be misleading to
convey this idea. For amusement and entertainment
is systematized by the Siberian, in what they
call a <i>sobrania</i>. As near as I can define it, this institution
is a sort of &#8220;circle,&#8221; or club, and the idea
might well be copied with some modifications in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
cities, or more especially, small towns in the United
States.</p>

<p>There was a first <i>sobrania</i> and a second <i>sobrania</i>
in Chita. I knew only the second. Probably the numerical
designation came from precedence in organization.
I suspect that the first one had degenerated
somewhat in its clientele or membership or
whatever they call it, but that may be only snobbishness
on my part&mdash;all the best people went to the
second <i>sobrania</i>, even including the chief of police
who was a comfortable person for the Siberians to
have present early in the morning drinking wine or
vodka after the hour when the sale of liquors was
supposed to cease. At least, my friends assured me
that so long as the chief was present, they felt perfectly
safe from police interference on the score of
making merry.</p>

<p>After midnight I felt the environment rather boring
and got away unless my departure might be construed
as a reflection on the habits of my Cossack
friends who had invited me for the evening. In
such cases, the evenings last till daylight, and in Siberia
in winter, daylight is scarce.</p>

<p>The first night I went to the <i>sobrania</i> I was
amazed. It was a large stone building of four stories
and basement. The basement contained billiard and
coat-rooms. On the floor above was a ball-room and
a theater. The next upper floor held a splendid
restaurant, decorated by the inevitable and luxurious
rubber plants. A German war-prisoner orchestra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
served for balls, theater, and after-theater
supper.</p>

<p>The plays were acted by a fairly good stock company,
and it was said, written by the wife of a local
general. If the latter were true she was an accomplished
dramatist, though I doubt if the police would
have allowed her plays to run on Broadway.</p>

<p>It is probable that the general&#8217;s wife did write
some of them, but more likely that such as I saw
she had adapted from French farces. They were
grossly nasty, to such an extent that it was evident
that they had been coarsened. Infidelity, of course,
was the basis of each one, the wife always being the
fool. And one case of infidelity was not enough
for a single play&mdash;all the characters were involved
in some way or another, to the uproarious delight
of the audience. And incidentally, I saw high school
children put on a play built around a button missing
from the most vital part of a man&#8217;s trousers.</p>

<p>No further comment needs to be made upon the
public morals of the Siberians. Yet curiously
enough, in all the dancing I observed, there was not
a hint of anything approaching the suggestive. In
fact, the dances were most pretty, and most decorous.
This might be explained by the fact that
the officers of Semenoff&#8217;s little army were always
armed, and are as quick with a pistol as the old-style
Westerner of our own country. Discretion in such
cases is not always a matter of morals.</p>

<p>And while I am discussing the morals of the Siberians,
I wish to say that before sailing from San<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Francisco I went to a noted restaurant for dinner,
where the prominent people of the city dine. There
I saw a woman dance in a state so close to nudity
that it was disgusting, and she did not dance upon
a stage, but among the tables. She was on the program
as a foreigner, a gipsy, I think. Thus as a
nation we are willing to be Orientalized. And our
best people go farther in permitting offense in dancing
than do the Siberians, judging from what I saw
in that country.</p>

<p>After the play in the <i>sobrania</i>, the dancing begins,
the seats being taken up to make extra room. But
between the acts a sort of promenade begins, in
which the whole audience goes out and walks around
in couples in the adjoining room. This promenade
is characteristic of all public gatherings, and leads
one to believe that the people are most gentle toward
each other in all relations&mdash;the men link arms,
and walk together, smoking and chatting; men and
women walk together and talk animatedly; there is
much bowing, and exchange of polite salutations between
friends. And this promenade once begun,
continues through all the time of dancing, so that
but about half those present at any particular time
are on the dancing floor.</p>

<p>While I was in Chita Cossack officers were there
from the Don, the Urals, the Ussuri, the Crimea.
There were handsome Georgians in flowing capes
lined with red and thrown over the shoulders to expose
the inner colorings. They wore rifle cartridges
sewn into the breasts of their tunics in regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
Cossack style, and sabers and scimitars with jeweled
hilts and scabbards of silver with exquisite filigree
work.</p>

<p>When some of these men reached a point of exhilaration
which prevented them from remaining
quiet, they improvised dances of their native heaths
as exhibitions, consisting of queer gesturings, much
leaping and clicking of heels in air, and intricate
dance steps, all being done with great skill to the
accompaniment of barbaric cries in keeping with
the performance. Such exhibitions were popular
and frequent, and at times the general dancing
stopped entirely in order that all hands might enjoy
the spectacle.</p>

<p>And while this merry-making was going on inside,
Semenoff&#8217;s men outside in the bitter cold were doing
double guard to protect the building from Bolshevist
raids or uprisings. Many a night going to the
<i>sobrania</i> with British officers and Captain and Mrs.
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> we were challenged and halted by patrols,
and on our way back to the hotel our drosky was frequently
held up by a group of men about a bon-fire
in the street and not permitted to go on till we had
identified ourselves.</p>

<p>I suspected that this excessive caution was due
more to Semenoff&#8217;s desire to impress the city with
the protection he afforded, than a necessity for
vigilance. By this method Semenoff demonstrated
his worth to the bankers and merchants of the city,
so that he found it easier to &#8220;borrow&#8221; money for
his military and other necessities.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>But to go out every evening to theaters and dinners,
knowing that venturing forth into the cold
night means to be challenged by none-too-careful
sentries (some of them more or less under the influence
of vodka and likely to shoot first and challenge
afterward) revealed some traits of the Siberian
character. They will have their amusement
despite all odds; they do not worry overmuch about
the condition of their government; they curse certain
foreigners for coming in and protecting them
and yet are suspicious of every native who sets himself
up as a military leader; they talk of their great
love of Russia but if they have their choice between
going to a salacious play or to a public gathering to
discuss the affairs of their stricken country, they
choose the play. There they know they will enjoy
themselves and can go through the forms of excessive
politeness with their friends and even with officers
belonging to the armies of Cossack and Russian
leaders who are mistrusted.</p>

<p>But if they all gathered to discuss the welfare of
Russia they know the meeting would probably end
in a near-riot, if not open warfare. So they find it
easier to be charmingly hospitable to possible enemies,
and presently whispering behind the backs of
the possible enemies about their treason to Holy
Russia.</p>

<p>In the meantime the reactionary forces grow
stronger, the general disorder gradually converts
the people to a belief that it would be better for a
monarchy to be restored, and certain imperial personages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
lurk in Harbin or other hiding places, waiting
for the time when the population will tire of
revolutionary conditions and demand a restoration
of the throne.</p>

<p>These monarchists speak vaguely of a &#8220;proper
time&#8221; in the future. Most of them have plenty of
money, and enjoy themselves waiting for this &#8220;proper
time.&#8221; The poorer peoples are steadily consuming
food surpluses, raising less each year; they are wearing
out their clothes and gradually approaching beggary
while they keep up a sort of continual celebration
over their freedom, as they call it.</p>

<p>The monarchists can afford to bide their time.
Our diplomats wait and wait for &#8220;things to settle
down.&#8221; They predict that Bolshevism will burn itself
out, when as a matter of fact the fuse is burning
closer to more destruction all the time. And Russian
and Germany money is being spent in various
countries of the world for the purpose of spreading
Bolshevist ideas, in order that other countries will
have troubles of their own and be compelled to leave
Russia alone. These ideas are nothing but class
hatred worked out subtly and made to appeal to people
whose reasoning powers are most primitive&mdash;or
to educated &#8220;idealists&#8221; who either have addled brains
in their heads or Bolshevist money in their pockets.</p>

<p>Tell me how people amuse themselves and I will
tell you what they are; tell me that they seek only
amusement when their country is in ruins, and they
cannot tell me that the patriotism they prate about
is genuine patriotism. It struck me that the Siberians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
were more concerned with what went down
their gullets than with a decent government and a
decent future for themselves and their children.</p>

<p>People get the government they deserve. People
are responsible for their governments. If they assert
that their rulers led them into war, it is not the fault
of their rulers, but their own, for their rulers know
them well enough to know what they could be led
into. If people whine that they are oppressed by an
autocracy, they confess that there is something lacking
in themselves. If they howl against capitalism,
when all the things they have could only be produced
for them by a system of capital invested to good purpose,
they lack brains; and if they cannot devise a
government which protects them from exploitation
they deserve to be exploited.</p>

<p>I do not believe that all capitalists combine power
with justice, any more than I believe that all working
men understand the laws of economics and would
create a r&eacute;gime of justice if they had all power in
their hands. They mistake the machine which has
been created to produce jobs for them, as the machine
by which they themselves create, when as a
matter of fact they themselves are only a part of the
machine. That they happen to be part of that machine
is not the fault of the inventor of the machine
or its owner, but their own.</p>

<p>Of course, the necessity for labor, on their part
may be due to a lack of opportunity due to bad government,
lack of education, misfortune or the thousand
and one elements of which an individual&#8217;s history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
may be composed. A man running a loom might
have been a scientist if he had been educated, but
he cannot turn himself into a scientist by burning the
factory in which he works.</p>

<p>This relation to work and play in connection with
Siberia I believe to be vital both in Siberia and in
other parts of the world. And I feel it necessary
to become personal in order to make clear what I
mean in a chapter dealing primarily with Siberian
love of amusement.</p>

<p>As a boy I worked in a woolen mill as a weaver.
In order to study while my loom was running, I
fastened books to the top of the frame and in moments
when the loom did not need my attention, I
would read a page or two out of a book. By this
method I often got through a book a day in addition
to producing the regular quantity of cloth. The odd
moments I gave to my books were spent by my fellow-weavers
in friendly conversation or in skylarking.</p>

<p>I was laughed at for trying to acquire an education.
I lost caste with young chaps of my own age
for &#8220;trying to be better than a weaver.&#8221; And right
then I learned this truth: People write or talk about
autocracy of capital, or autocracy of government, or
autocracy of class, but&mdash;the greatest autocrat in the
world is the ignorant person&mdash;he resents everybody
who is not as ignorant as himself, and he seeks to
pull down to his level those who would surpass him
in ability, manual or mental.</p>

<p>I mention this because I found exactly the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
attitude of mind on the part of the &#8220;workers&#8221; in
Siberia, as I found among my former loom-mates.
It was that no one works unless he wears old clothes
and appears at a certain place at a certain time to
labor for a certain period.</p>

<p>The Siberian has much more reason for having
that attitude than the American, for the former has
been prevented from gaining an education, or thinks
he has, and has been told repeatedly that only such
labor as he understands, produces anything.</p>

<p>Just as many a laborer resents a white shirt, a
collar and cuffs, a well-tailored suit worn by a man
who apparently does no hard work, the laborer sometimes
resents good grammar and good manners from
any man who is thrown in contact with him.</p>

<p>It is said that Trotsky goes about unshaven, and
in an old suit of clothes, when he wishes to speak to
his adherents on terms of familiarity. Having
taught the proletariat to destroy the upper classes,
he is consistent enough outwardly to pull himself
down to the level of his dupes. This is merely the
trick of the sly demagogue, who, when he goes
among working men seeking votes, puts off the frock
coat and silk hat and gets into a cap and overalls.
The inference is that he must be honest and is sincerely
seeking to represent the working man because
he appears in the habiliments of labor.</p>

<p>This spirit of class hatred has been developed to
the ultimate degree in Siberia, and the man with a
clean collar, a shave, and clean hands must be an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
enemy of the proletariat, as the proletarian sees
him, simply by having those things.</p>

<p>I heard the provodnik of my fourth-class car refer
to me insolently as an aristocrat because he observed
me trying to shave and wash my face. Two
days later, having allowed myself to become unshaven
and otherwise unkempt, he became most
friendly, and instead of regarding me as an aristocrat,
began to address me as &#8220;comrade.&#8221; I had evidently
won his good regard by being dirty.</p>

<p>So amusement is closely identified with the condition
of a people, both in their material and spiritual
welfare, as well as in the evils of a bad government.
When people insist upon having amusement
which they cannot afford, they are ripe for the
tyrant, and their government goes to pot. Prosperity
has done more damage to the human race
than adversity&mdash;prosperity which is used only for an
excess of amusement.</p>

<p>With the <i>sobranias</i> of Chita filled to overflowing
every night, with wealthy and poor seeking to
be diverted with vodka, dancing and eating all night,
and sleeping most of the day, where is it possible to
begin aiding them in the forming of a government
of their own? If they are willing to allow various
self-seeking usurpers of government to set up military
establishments and gradually become local
princelings waiting for the time that their power can
be sold out to some imperial personage who wishes
to restore a throne, why should we quarrel with these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
princelings or about them&mdash;the Semenoffs, the Kalmikoffs
and others who are of the same stripe?</p>

<p>That is what the monarchists mean when they talk
about the &#8220;proper time,&#8221; to restore the monarchy&mdash;the
time when the local chiefs find it convenient to
sell out, and there is a buyer handy who knows how
to wear a crown&mdash;and swing a saber over the heads
of the multitude.</p>

<p>Then there will be people in Russia and in that
part of the Empire of old known as Siberia, who will
rise and assert that the Allies, or the United States,
or somebody, betrayed them. They will say that our
&#8220;watchful waiting,&#8221; and our assurances of friendship
and our efforts to aid with Red Cross supplies,
and our &#8220;we don&#8217;t know what to do&#8221; policy, was
merely our waiting for a &#8220;proper time&#8221; to hand them
over to a new Czar.</p>

<p>That is why I say the <i>sobranias</i> with their dirty
plays, filled with audiences roaring gleefully over indecency,
should have been filled nightly with Siberians
threshing out the problems which confronted
them. No. They were concerned chiefly with consuming
the supply of vodka, with the women who
sifted through the port of Vladivostok or came up
from Harbin, and with cursing discreetly behind
their hands the gentlemanly Japanese officer who
went to see the fun. I wonder if some of these Japanese,
accused by the Siberians of secretly desiring to
capture Siberia, did not realize with Japanese astuteness
that the Siberians were conquering themselves.
There is no necessity for the Japanese fighting with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
the Siberians for Siberia, when the Siberians seem
to be bent upon eliminating themselves.</p>

<p>Of course the Siberians are friendly to the United
States&mdash;remember that the American officer whom I
relieved in Chita had been threatened with assassination.
This officer was a foreigner, who by faithful
service in our old regular army, had acquired a commission
in our native forces of the Philippines,
known as the Philippine Scouts. I am not sure what
his nationality was&mdash;a Pole or a Ukranian. I think
the chief objection to him was the belief in certain
quarters in Chita that he was a Jew.</p>

<p>The United States makes a mistake when it sends
a Jewish official to represent it in any foreign country
which is anti-Jewish, not because the Jew is incapable
in any way, but because the nation he represents
is forgotten, and only the fact that he is a Jew,
is remembered. We of the United States who have
no racial or religious prejudices against the Jew find
it hard to realize the hatred that is held for them
in a country like Russia.</p>

<p>Since my stay in Siberia I am convinced that the
hatred of the Jew is neither racial nor religious at
bottom. It is based on a resentment of any person or
race which is ambitious, which has foresight, which
attends to business, and so gets ahead. The Chinese
in Siberia are hated as much as the Jews, though not
so badly persecuted. This is because, as I understand
it, the Chinese attend to their business while the
native is sleeping off the effects of liquor or late
hours. The Siberian dislikes anybody who represents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
&#8220;unfair competition&#8221;&mdash;the doing a full day&#8217;s work.
I believe the Japanese are hated chiefly for the same
reason&mdash;being up and doing, looking ahead, preparing
for the cold winter during the warm summer.
All lazy persons resent the man or woman who
works. The Siberian was born lazy.</p>

<p>The general Russian workman in a factory will
not work a minute more than he is compelled to.
I read an article by a Russian woman in this country
who ascribes this laziness of her countrymen to an
artistic temperament&mdash;they need a certain amount
of dreaming, and their spiritual condition is better
than that of the American, who is always too busy
to enjoy life and understand the inner meanings
of life. That may be so, but I believe that the
average American working man who arrives at
his work punctually and quits with the whistle,
gets as much of the &#8220;inner meanings of life&#8221;
as the Russian who reaches the factory an hour late,
and then wants to assassinate the owner of the factory
because the boss scolds the Russian for being
late. Maybe this yearning for assassination is indicative
of understanding the inner meaning of life.</p>

<p>To disagree in Siberia means to desire to kill.
That is one reason why the <i>sobranias</i> were full of
rollickers every night in Chita. To sit in a theater
beside a man who is laughing at a play while you
yourself laugh at the same things he does, prevents
anything in the nature of a disagreement. Two men
can get drunk together with a certain degree of
safety, but in Siberia if they should meet sober and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
begin to talk about government, they might fight a
duel. Perhaps they would rather remain alive than
to attempt to agree on how the nation should be
conducted.</p>

<p>While I was in Siberia I read in an American
newspaper that an American member of Congress
demanded information as to why the United States
was not co&ouml;perating with the Russian Zemstvos in
organizing a nucleus for a representative Russian
government. If he had been with me the day I read
of his demand, I could have taken him and shown
him a zemstvo so drunk that its members did not
know their first names. The only way in which anybody
might have co&ouml;perated with them, would have
been to buy them a bottle of vodka. This was their
way of killing time while waiting for our government
to make up its mind on Siberia.</p>

<p>In answer to my suggestion that the Siberians
of Chita should have gathered to discuss government
in their <i>sobranias</i>, they might well state that if
they attempted to discuss government in any way
than to pass resolutions in favor of Semenoff&#8217;s government,
they stood a good chance of being executed
with dispatch. It would be a fairly good answer.
Especially, as the United States merely showed mild
interest when Semenoff executed a batch of people.
If the United States as represented by the Siberian
expedition, the commander being so instructed and
properly backed up, had told Semenoff that he had
not yet acquired the right to execute anybody and
that he would not be allowed to usurp that right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
that would have been co&ouml;peration with the people
of Siberia. But co&ouml;peration of that kind might be
interpreted as interference, and we were pledged by
somebody not to interfere with the Siberians.</p>

<p>So the Siberians took good care, and wisely, not
to interfere with Semenoff. But we remained in Siberia
with our forces, and proved ourselves to be so
gentle and considerate of others, that certain Siberians
have dared to interfere with us to the extent
of killing some of our officers and soldiers.</p>

<p>The Semenoffs and the Kalmikoffs did not love
us any more because we did not interfere with them;
the Siberians did not love us because we did not interfere
with these petty tyrants; but we would have
won the love of all hands if we had done something&mdash;that
is, all hands but the Bolshevists, and since we
have probed into their works at home, I doubt if we
seek their love. At least the Bolshevists would have
learned to respect us if we had done something beside
invite them to the Prinkipo conference, an invitation
which they greeted with loud laughter and
other demonstrations of their scorn for our good intentions.</p>

<p>So the <i>sobranias</i> of Chita, and other cities in
Siberia, served to while away the time for the populace,
while they waited for the United States to
make up its mind about what to do in Siberia. If
we had taken a definite stand, and demanded that
the Siberians show us what they could do while we
protected them from themselves and the Cossacks,
the <i>sobranias</i> might have been filled with committees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
and delegates, and people learning something
about what they must do to have a government, instead
of being filled with revelers.</p>

<p>If we think we can wait till these people meet our
ideas of what government is, we are making a great
mistake. We must show them. They have been
kept ignorant for centuries, in order that they might
be kept in subjection. They have not been educated,
because the ruling class wanted cheap labor. Cheap
labor becomes very expensive labor when it destroys
the employer, the factory and the government.
Cheap labor that listens to such arguments as the
Bolshevists give it, is a mighty costly commodity to
any nation, whether that labor is native or imported.</p>

<small>POLITICS AND PRINKIPO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the time that I was in Chita, Ataman Semenoff
and Kolchak were at odds. Kolchak, accusing
Semenoff with interfering with railroad traffic at
Chita and so hampering Kolchak&#8217;s &#8220;All Russian
Government&#8221; in Omsk, issued his famous order in
which he denounced Semenoff as a traitor. And
while that order stood, Kolchak or Kolchak&#8217;s officers,
asked Semenoff to send his forces to Irkutsk
and other points toward Omsk to anticipate Bolshevist
uprisings which were threatened.</p>

<p>Semenoff declined to lend his forces so long as
Kolchak branded him as a traitor. He denied that
he had interfered with trains bound to or from
Omsk, and denied that he had cut telegraph wires
or held up messages.</p>

<p>On January second, Ivanoff-Renoff (Ivanov-Renov),
&#8220;Commanding General of the Siberian army
and Ataman of Siberian Cossacks,&#8221; according to the
card I got from him, arrived in Chita in a special
train with a staff. He had come from Kolchak to
treat with Semenoff, and find out on what terms
Semenoff would join Kolchak against the Bolshevists.</p>

<p>I called upon General Ivanoff-Renoff. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
at tea in his dining-car, with three or four of his
staff. He is a tall, soldierly man, with thin face,
clean-cut jaws, and most alert and intelligent. He
impressed me as being the ideal type of Russian general
in appearance. Proud without being haughty,
frank without conveying the idea that he sought the
good graces of anybody for the purpose of misleading
them, a manner of quiet determination which
suggested that he would not hesitate to be cruel if
necessary to gain his ends, he looked every inch the
commander. He wore several imperial orders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commanding General of the Siberian Army and
Ataman of Siberian Cossacks&#8221; was rather a wide
and all-embracing description, considering the fact
that Semenoff commanded some five thousand men
supposed to be Siberians, and was himself a Siberian
Ataman in Trans-Baikal. There probably was some
conflict of authority, yet the Trans-Baikal has been
represented to me as not being really Siberia. However,
stand Ivanoff-Renoff beside Semenoff, in civilian
attire, and on the instant I would select Ivanoff-Renoff
as a Siberian Cossack chief, and hire Semenoff
for a motorman. I do not mean to imply by
this that Semenoff&#8217;s abilities do not go beyond his
being a motorman, but merely wish to state that,
compared with Ivanoff-Renoff, Semenoff does not
contrast favorably with the other.</p>

<p>At that time, it was reported that Trotsky had
said that the Bolshevist government would control
all Russia in six months. I had my interpreter quote
Trotsky to Ivanoff-Renoff. He smiled grimly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
said: &#8220;Before then we will have hanged Trotsky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ivanoff-Renoff remained several days in Chita. I
heard that Semenoff offered to join forces with Kolchak
if the latter would withdraw the &#8220;traitor&#8221;
order, but that in no case could he co&ouml;perate with
Kolchak while that order stood. I do not see that
Semenoff could take any other stand.</p>

<p>Ivanoff-Renoff investigated the charges that
Semenoff had interfered with supply and troop trains
for Kolchak, and I heard that he reported to Omsk
that there had been misunderstandings, or exaggerations,
and that the charge should be withdrawn
against Semenoff, together with the &#8220;traitor&#8221; order.
It seems that Kolchak was not satisfied with this
report, and in time Ivanoff-Renoff departed for
Vladivostok, and was reported to have broken with
Kolchak because Kolchak did not take his recommendations
in the proper spirit. It was said that a
commission would be sent by Kolchak to take the
matter up in detail, which I suppose made Ivanoff-Renoff
feel that his services were of no more value
to Kolchak. It would be absurd to suppose that I
knew the real truth of what was going on.</p>

<p>Both parties were probably playing for time, and
keeping the Allies confused. And all hands were
waiting to see which way the cat of the Peace Conference
in Paris would jump. There was a new
rumor in the corridors of the Hotel Select every
fifteen minutes. If I had attempted to report them
to Vladivostok, it would have taken a dozen private
wires and as many expert operators. But I did put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
considerable credence in the rumour that Grand Duke
Michael was in Harbin waiting for the &#8220;proper
time&#8221; to accomplish a coup d&#8217;etat and take the
throne.</p>

<p>As a sample of Asiatic intrigue, while Ivanoff-Renoff
was in Chita, it was rumored that Semenoff
was going to Harbin for a conference with some
mysterious person. It was also said that the Ataman
needed the services of a surgeon, as his wounds from
the bomb were not healing properly. Two days
later it was reported that the Ataman had suffered
a collapse and returned to his bed, and that the
trip to Harbin was postponed indefinitely.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, a couple of private cars of
the Ataman had been run up on a siding close to his
residence, and the night that he was supposed to be
back in his bed, he secretly boarded his train, and
was whisked down the line. And his staff officers
who remained in Chita were gravely informing me
that the Ataman was at home and feeling very ill.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the amount of dependence
which could be put in information given out by
Semenoff&#8217;s headquarters. It reveals the reason why
Americans and Russians were not co&ouml;perating to the
puzzlement of our statesmen at home. As a matter
of fact, Semenoff went to Harbin, and then went on
to Vladivostok. And I so reported to Vladivostok.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_230a"><img src="images/i_230a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AN EXAMPLE OF CARVING ON A TYPICAL SIBERIAN HOUSE</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_230b"><img src="images/i_230b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">TYPICAL RUSSIAN CHURCH IN CITIES OF SIBERIA</p>

<p>Yet while Semenoff&#8217;s train was lying in the yards
of Vladivostok, and our own headquarters were
watching for him, headquarters got a story that
Semenoff was still in Chita, and certain staff officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
were rather peevish that they should be misled as
to the whereabouts of Semenoff. They were told
that Semenoff happened to be in their front yard,
and to look a little closer for him there. They did,
and found him.</p>

<p>It was about this time that news reached us in
Chita that the Bolshevist leaders had been invited
to meet at Prinkipo with the delegates of the Peace
Conference. Our dispatch was translated into Russian
by our Committee on Public Information in Siberia,
and telegraphed to all the Siberian newspapers.</p>

<p>The effect was similar to letting loose about my
ears a hornet&#8217;s nest. A Japanese staff-officer came
to my room in haste to ask what it meant. He
seemed afraid that the United States intended to
recognize the Bolshevist government. And he was
extremely puzzled, which of course reflected the
attitude of General Oba, which was that after the
Allies had come into Siberia to restore order the
United States appeared about to take sides with
those creating the disorder.</p>

<p>In any event, the United States appeared willing
to treat with Bolshevism, a fact which would
strengthen Bolshevism. All I could say was that the
Prinkipo invitation was obviously based upon conditions
of which we in Siberia knew nothing, and that
it was likely that the text of the message as we received
it, had been garbled in transit.</p>

<p>The humorous aspect of the invitation was that
&#8220;all parties&#8221; were invited to be in Prinkipo, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Sea of Marmora by the first of February, or some
fifteen days after the invitation was issued. Considering
the fact that it had taken me thirteen days
to travel from Vladivostok to Chita, a distance of
two thousand versts, fifteen days for all delegates
from Russia and Siberia to get to Prinkipo revealed
the fact that those who set the date were ignorant
of the conditions of travel in Siberia&mdash;or bluffing
diplomatically.</p>

<p>So the Japanese were perturbed by the Prinkipo
invitation&mdash;that is, as perturbed as a Japanese permits
himself to be.</p>

<p>The effect on the Cossack officers of Siberia, was
to fill them with suspicion toward the United States,
to make them feel that we were not playing fair with
them, and to give them the impression that they had
been betrayed into the hands of the Bolshevists. In
other words, that the Bolshevists were right, and
that all anti-Bolshevist forces were wrong.</p>

<p>The information we got was to the effect that
President Wilson recognized a state of revolution in
Russia and desired no counter-revolutionary action.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we are counter-revolutionists,&#8221; expostulated
an officer high in the councils of Semenoff. &#8220;We
have been fighting the Bolshevists from the first, and
always will fight them. This information that your
president is willing to hold a conference with a lot
of robbers and murderers, spread broadcast over
the country, gives the Bolshevists a standing they
have never had before. And that is not the worst
of it&mdash;we have in our armies men who have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
Bolshevists, and who have been more or less argued
out of it. These men are now beginning to suspect
that our representations to them against Bolshevism
are false, and we may have mutiny in our forces. It
has been hard enough to fight Bolshevist propaganda,
in and out of our armies, but this thing has
made us afraid that we cannot hold the former
active Bolshevists and Bolshevist sympathizers
whom we have won to our side. Even if nothing is
done toward a conference, this invitation in itself
will do our cause great harm, and the Bolshevist
leaders much good. We feel that the United States
has turned against us, or will in time recognize the
Bolshevist government.&#8221;</p>

<p>All I could do was to state that President Wilson
was the head of my government, and commander
in chief of our army, and that no matter what course
he pursued, no matter what orders he or his subordinate
officers issued, I should obey. And that if
I were in a position to know his intentions and all the
facts in the matter, my personal opinion could have
no effect upon my obedience to orders. And that I
could not enter into a discussion of decisions made in
Paris or elsewhere regarding the policy of the
United States. Also, that I had faith that the United
States would act consistently with its history and
aspirations, and for the good of Russia. I asserted
that the invitation to Prinkipo might be a desire to
get the Bolshevist leaders to define their position
regarding Russia, and to commit themselves to a line
of action&mdash;in other words to state their ideas and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
ideals. And if their desires did not meet approval,
then we would take a stand against Bolshevism and
the Bolshevists. But my arguments did not reassure
him much&mdash;he felt that all the damage had been
done.</p>

<p>Now I found a new spirit among those persons
who were known to me as Bolshevist sympathizers.
I had had many frank talks with some of these
people, and had listened to their arguments in favor
of Bolshevism. These people now became almost
insolent. They told me in effect that I ought to go
home, as my president had taken preliminary steps
to recognize the Bolshevist government, seeing that
it would be useless to combat the Bolshevist rule.
They were right, and I was wrong by being there in
their country, and what was I doing, they asked,
walking around with a pistol in my belt. My answer
to this was, if my president felt they were right,
and that the presence of American troops in Siberia
was wrong, my president as commander in chief
would withdraw the American forces from Siberia.
All my Bolshevist friends had to do, and all I had
to do, I told them, was wait for that order.</p>

<p>For an officer who was practically on diplomatic
duty, it was rather a peculiar position&mdash;far inland
in Siberia, with all parties suspicious of him and his
government. The Bolshevists regarded me with
more open hostility, the anti-Bolshevists not quite
sure I was a friend, the principal Allied power in
Chita somewhat hurt and suspicious that it might
be discredited in Siberia, and such Russians as concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
whatever partisanship they secretly held, discouraged
and believing that their country was to be
betrayed to the Bolshevists by the nation which they
looked to for the most aid and moral support. And
American officers and civilians were scattered
through the country, practically alone, and far from
supporting or protecting troops.</p>

<p>For a couple of weeks the Hotel Select buzzed
with noisy discussions in which the principal word
was &#8220;Americanskys.&#8221; More than ever, I felt that
any nation sending its forces into a country, should
know what it intends to do before such troops are
sent. And if it gets an expedition into a foreign
country and finds that conditions have changed
which leaves the purposes for which the expedition
may be used, in doubt, the expedition should be put
into transports and sent to its own territory. No
man should expect to be a leader without being
willing to make decisions, and assume the responsibility
for his decisions. The man who is not brave
enough to make a decision, should be retired to private
life. The quality of a man&#8217;s decisions is the
only test of his leadership, regardless of what his
uttered ideals may be. Good intentions with bad
decisions will ruin a nation much more quickly than
autocratic ideas wisely expressed in action.</p>

<p>The United States must expect leadership in all
its executive branches because the will of the people
in our vast country regarding foreign affairs solidifies
too slowly for the man in power during a crisis
to follow public opinion in matters which touch upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
the safety of the nation. National good must stand
above the good of parties.</p>

<p>I was more discouraged by the views of the Prinkipo
invitation than were the Siberians or the Japanese.
They suspected my attitude, for I had always
expressed myself as opposed to Bolshevism. But the
Cossacks had difficulty in understanding my reticence
regarding my private opinions and my avowal
that I would stand with my political chiefs. Probably
they thought I should ferment an American
revolution!</p>

<p>The Japanese understood better, I think, loyalty
to government. Probably, knowing I was anti-Bolshevist,
they expected me to commit hara-kiri.</p>

<small>FAREWELL TO CHITA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> routine of every day ran along about the
same as ever for about a week after the Prinkipo invitation
to the Bolshevists had unsettled our little
world in Chita. But I noted a decided coolness from
all parties, or so it seemed to me. My old stock
phrases about the &#8220;friendship of the United States
for a great and reunited Russia&#8221; did not ring so true
when I got up at banquets to say something pleasant.</p>

<p>And as the toasts to President Wilson and the
United States at these affairs became less frequent
and less fervid, I began to feel like a wet blanket at
joyous occasions to which I had been invited. But I
will say that the Russians and the Japanese covered
whatever chagrin they felt in fine style and never
relaxed their kindness.</p>

<p>At about this time there was a complete upheaval
in Semenoff&#8217;s staff. New officers got into control, and
the old ones, with whom I had been on most friendly
terms, went into retirement, which generally took
the form of a trip to Harbin, or an absence explained
by a necessity for a jaunt to some other city. This
new staff, with one or two exceptions, struck me as
being composed of the less capable officers in military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
administration, but well schooled in intrigue.
In effect, it seemed to me that Semenoff was gradually
drawing to him such officers as gave him the
worst advice. Some of them were of a very low
type of mind, and distinguished themselves at banquets
by their ability to get so drunk that they had
to lean on the table when they stood up to make
maundering speeches.</p>

<p>I remember one officer who sat at the head of a
great table and represented the Ataman while
Semenoff was out of the city. He was in a drunken
stupor, with his head resting on his chest, when the
Cossack band in the next room broke out into a loud
and rattly patriotic air. The host roused himself and
got to his feet. He showed every sign of being inspired
to utter profound thoughts. He put up a
swaying arm, as a signal for somebody to stop the
band, and when a young officer ran out into the next
room, the tune did stop abruptly. Meanwhile, the
presiding officer hung in stays for a full five minutes
like a ship waiting to come up into the wind. Suddenly
the bandsmen, evidently feeling that the
silence in the next room should be covered, broke
out again in music. It was checked none too politely.</p>

<p>Once more the officer gathered himself, and managed
to blurt out the single word: &#8220;Russians!&#8221;
Then he lapsed into silence. The band exploded, so
to speak, beginning on the very bar on which they
had left off. Somebody hurled an empty vodka bottle
into the next room, and demanded silence. The
band stopped. This intermittent playing sounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
for all the world like a gigantic phonograph being
stopped and started while somebody tinkered with
its machinery.</p>

<p>Our officer uttered a sentence in Russian, swayed
and sat down heavily in his chair. He was asleep
by the time he touched the seat. Another officer felt
that he must fill the breach and cover the failure of
his superior. He was not quite so drunk as his chief.
He strode to the balustrade of a balcony, dragging
behind him his heavy saber, which had become unhooked.
He raised his arm to command attention,
and the sudden readjustment of his center of gravity
threw him heavily against the balustrade. He lost
his balance and fell off the balcony, a distance of
some ten feet to the floor.</p>

<p>But the floor was merely a landing at the head
of a long stairway. In getting up he missed his footing,
and tumbled the length of the stairs, his descent
being accompanied by the musical rattle of his saber.
The cooks in the kitchen picked him up, and somebody
ordered the band to resume playing, which it
did, at the very note where it had last left off. No
one dared to laugh.</p>

<p>In itself, this incident may appear trifling. Yet it
must be borne in mind that at the table was the
governing body of Chita, less the Ataman himself.
But the Ataman&#8217;s brother was there, a distinguished-looking
man wearing a Japanese order. And he
was not drunk. Mr. Tashkin, the head of the &#8220;civil
government&#8221; of the province, was also present&mdash;sober,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
quiet, dignified. I wondered what he was
thinking while this orgy was going on.</p>

<p>And Japanese officers were present, jolly but self-contained,
spending most of their time explaining to
some insistent Russian officer that they could not
drink any more champagne. And all the Russian
speeches were of a most patriotic character, and told
of the wonderful things in store for Russia under
the flags of Ataman Semenoff.</p>

<p>Marvels were to be accomplished by all those
present to restore Holy Russia to her greatness before
the world. The soldiers serving the tables were
quiet and sober. It did not take gigantic brain power
to understand that Russia would never regain any
great powers with Semenoffs set in the saddle.</p>

<p>And I managed, quite by mistake, to get into the
kitchen in the basement when I went down for my
coat and cap. There I found at an early hour in
the morning, a group of poor old men and women
in dirty rags mechanically going about their work of
cleaning dishes and mopping the floors. And they
looked at the Americansky officer with inquiring
eyes. Somewhere in their brains I suspect they wondered
if the Americans were upholding Semenoff&#8217;s
r&eacute;gime. It looked that way. Was I not a guest at
the banquet?</p>

<p>This exposition of what was going on in Chita
may appear to be bad form on the part of one who
was a guest. But in effect I was the United States
at that banquet, and the people of the United States
were paying me as an officer to learn as much about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
Siberia as I could, and the people of the United
States have a right to know what I learned.</p>

<p>My hosts knew I was an official guest, and their
hospitality was not really hospitality to me in the
proper sense, but an attempt to gain my esteem by
proving to me that they were good fellows. They
thought that champagne would gain for them a
favorable report from me. But the future of Russia,
and more particularly future relations and understandings
between the United States and Russia,
should not rest on the good-fellowship of wine. I
can report on the splendid hospitality of the Siberians,
as dispensed on their own understanding of
hospitality. I cannot say I would commend Semenoff&#8217;s
officers as suitable administrators. It is quite
likely that while the band was playing, they were
having several persons executed in a grove. Festivity
has been known to be used as a cover for firing
squads.</p>

<p>Semenoff and others had lost hope that the United
States would co&ouml;perate with them against the Bolshevists,
and had turned to other agencies from
which they might expect financial aid and moral
support.</p>

<p>We demanded that an ideal government be
formed before we would recognize any. If an actual
honest and competent government had been formed
I doubt if we would have recognized it, because no
government could, or will be formed, which will not
be criticized by some Russian faction. And all some
Russian had to do in order to discredit with us any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
government or leader that rose, was to whisper that
such was &#8220;monarchists,&#8221; or &#8220;not representative,&#8221; or
&#8220;reactionary.&#8221; And all of those charges would be
true, for the simple reason that in any group of Russians
which can be gathered together there are
bound to be among them some who are monarchists,
or not representative of all Russia, or reactionary.</p>

<p>Kolchak formed a government at Omsk in
November, 1918. He has not been recognized yet
by the United States. Some say he is a monarchist
in his sympathies. A former officer of the Czar&#8217;s
fleet, his training and sympathies are bound to be
monarchistic in tendency. He feels that a firm hand
is necessary in dealing with the Russian situation. If
we had recognized him promptly, and backed him
up, Semenoff and Kalmikoff and other lesser lights
would have had to adhere to him at once. All power
for the regeneration of Russia would have been co&ouml;rdinated,
and all ambitions of Cossack chiefs to
become local princes, would have been swept away.
They would have had to join the parade, and the
other Allies would have been willing enough to follow
our lead. And a lot of bickering and killing
would have been stopped.</p>

<p>For that matter, to give Semenoff and Kalmikoff
their due, if they had been recognized, with limitations
of their authority, those leaders would have
given up much of their petty intriguing from the
first, and swung into line behind the United States.
They would have listened to our advice.</p>

<p>The whole question when our expedition first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
landed, was &#8220;What will the United States do?&#8221; The
answer in a couple of months was: &#8220;The United
States will do nothing&mdash;let us start something ourselves,
which will repay us for the trouble we have
had fighting the Bolshevists.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the secret trading began, the forcing of loans
from banks got bolder, there was aid which we deprecated
from certain quarters to these Cossack
chiefs. We played a dog-in-the-manger game, with
Christmas-Tree decorations in the form of Red
Cross aid, and Y. M. C. A., and Committee on
Public Information, and Trade Boards. We conferred
and commissioned and sent official representatives
in military uniform to various places to
make friends, while Bolshevists killed off a vast
population, and Cossack chiefs, under the plea of
exterminating Bolshevists, executed personal enemies.</p>

<p>We sent two or three hundred railroad engineers
into the country, they all thinking that they would
be in the army. When they applied for government
insurance, they were told they were not in the army.
But they wore the uniforms and insignia of our army
officers, and when some of them wanted to get out
of the country and go home, they were not allowed
to quit their jobs. Members of this organization
told me that they had been given to understand that
if they insisted upon resigning, they could do so, but
that they need never again expect to hold a job with
an American railroad. And the Russians said that
Russian money was paying the salaries of these men&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
that these Americans were there to steal the
railroad from the Russians. That may sound absurd.
But such absurdities thrust at men in Siberia are
not pleasant. They reveal to some slight extent the
difficult environments in which Americans found
themselves in Siberia.</p>

<p>So while in January the temperature hung around
seventy degrees below zero, the social atmosphere
was about as cold. Some weeks before, having replied
to a request that I class myself for discharge
or for permanent commission in the army, I had
requested discharge.</p>

<p>On January twenty-sixth, in reply to my classification
request, I got orders to return to Vladivostok
as soon as an officer who was to relieve me,
arrived in Chita. I had offered my services for the
war, and the war was over.</p>

<p>I immediately informed my friends that I was
leaving soon for the United States. General Oba&#8217;s
chief of staff gave a Japanese dinner at headquarters,
and invited the British officers and me. We had
a most enjoyable time, free from the drunkenness
which marked Siberian affairs. In fact, it was my
most enjoyable official function in Chita.</p>

<p>I made my official call on Oba the day of my
departure, and he came to my room to say farewell.
I was sincerely sorry to say good-bye to him.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> had planned to
go to Vladivostok before I was relieved. They delayed
their departure in order to go with me. And
we went in the private car of a Russian colonel who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
was going to Harbin. He was in Semenoff&#8217;s service,
but I surmised that he was too high a type of officer
and gentleman ever to get very far in the councils
of the Ataman. I did not remember having met
him before in Chita&mdash;a rougher element held the
front of the stage most of the time.</p>

<p>As the colonel&#8217;s car was in the yards, we did not
have to sit in the station and wait for the train which
was due to arrive from Irkutsk at nine o&#8217;clock in
the evening of January 31st.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the coldest weather I had ever
experienced when with Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span>
and Werkstein, I set out from the Hotel Select.
There was a gentle breeze blowing&mdash;a barely perceptible
movement of the air&mdash;which intensified the
seventy-below temperature. In the five minutes we
were crossing the square before the station, walking
against the pressure of a zephyr barely strong
enough to stir a feather, the tears ran out of my
eyes and froze on my cheeks, and my nose was frost-bitten
before I could get the fur band of my cap
across it.</p>

<p>I looked back at the line of shops and restaurants.
The lights were shining through a gray haze of
frozen fog, the doors were shrouded with arches of
icicles like entrances to fairy grottoes.</p>

<p>We plunged into the dark labyrinth of lines of
cars in the yards. A private train of Semenoff, with
the palatial coaches of the old days, protected by a
few stamping sentries. Nearby was the Ataman&#8217;s
armored cars, with the muzzles of field-pieces and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
machine-guns jutting out over the steel sides which
were gleaming white with hoar frost in the pale light
of the chilled stars. A dim light spilling from our
private car, revealed letters a yard high painted on
the end of an armored box-car, in Russian &#8220;Cemehobr,&#8221;
or Semenoff.</p>

<p>I could see in the distance, lights in the upper
rooms of the Ataman&#8217;s residence. Probably a council
of state was being held&mdash;or only an informal
gathering of women who had recently been brought
up from Harbin. Above the clamor of the crowds of
refugees in the station, I heard the howling of
wolves in the hills.</p>

<p>We got aboard the colonel&#8217;s car, and went to bed.
The train which was due at nine that night to pick
us up, did not pull us out of the city of convicts till
nine in the morning of February 1, 1919.</p>

<p>I was started on my journey for New York,
exactly on the other side of the world. I was content.</p>

<small>CHITA TO VLADIVOSTOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> about five days we reached Manchuria Station,
also known as Mandchuli. At this station we had to
change trains, for it was the end of the Baikal division
of the railroad and trains for Vladivostok
were made up there.</p>

<p>This line being the Chinese Eastern, all stations
had our American officers on duty, these men being
railroad men serving in the Russian Railway Service.
Though we had come this far in the private car of
the Russian colonel bound for Harbin, it was advisable
to arrange for room in the Vladivostok train
where the train was made up, for it would be next
to impossible to get accommodations out of Harbin.</p>

<p>I had asked my telegraph operators at Chita to
notify by wire the American officer on duty at Manchuria
Station the time my train left Chita, and to
have him hold for me a coup&eacute;, or sleeping compartment,
in the proper Vladivostok train. But my operators
gave the time I went aboard the private car as
time of my departure, saying I had left on Number
Four at nine in the evening of January thirty-first.
But the Number Four which picked up our car did
not leave till nine the following morning. And we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
made such slow progress, being five days in getting
to Manchuria Station, that reservation had been
made for me on the Vladivostok train departing the
morning before I arrived.</p>

<p>As we pulled into Manchuria Station in the gray
dawn of seven o&#8217;clock, I saw the frost-covered steel
cars of the Vladivostok train lying alongside us. It
was due to leave at nine o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>We hastened out of our car with our numerous
bags, boxes of food, and cooking utensils. Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> stood guard over our property, Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
went to the crowded station restaurant for hot tea,
and I went to the telegraph office to find which compartment
of the Vladivostok train had been reserved
for me. I passed the train on the way to the station,
and it was already packed full of people&mdash;in seats,
aisles and on platforms.</p>

<p>Nobody in the telegraph office had ever heard of
reserving anything for me. Neither had the sleepy
men in the station-master&#8217;s office. I asked for the
American officer to whom I had telegraphed&mdash;he had
been sent to Harbin to hospital, ill. (He died there
immediately.) Yes, there was another officer in his
place&mdash;name unknown, whereabouts unknown. He
generally appeared about nine o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Hastening back to Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> with the bad
news, we visited the Vladivostok train to see if we
might secure some space. That is, we went near to
it, and watched mobs fighting to get aboard every
car. It was hopeless. The weather was fifty below
zero. We saw the Vladivostok train pull out at nine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
leaving us in a swarming station, high and dry on
our baggage, to wait till nine o&#8217;clock the next morning.</p>

<p>The Chinese customs authorities demanded my
lockers, and collected eighty-four rubles in customs
duty. A long line of Russians and Chinese, which
reached the entire length of the long and dark corridor
in the station, waited before the closed ticket
window&mdash;to buy tickets for the train leaving twenty-four
hours later. Many of them had been camping
there for days, having food brought to them from
the restaurant, in order to buy tickets, which incidentally,
gave them only the right to try and get
aboard the train.</p>

<p>We breakfasted in the restaurant, it requiring
two hours before we were served. And we waited
more than an hour before we could get a seat, while
Russians and Chinese held the seats and read newspapers
over a single cup of tea.</p>

<p>Shortly after nine the American railway officer
appeared, and told me that he had reserved space
in the Vladivostok train the morning before. As we
had not claimed it, he had come to the conclusion
that we had not left Chita at all, so did not make
any reservation in the next train.</p>

<p>In disgust Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> suggested that we go
to the local <i>sobrania</i> and kill time eating. We walked
there, some dozen blocks distant, in the face of a
gentle breeze, which intensified the bitter cold.</p>

<p>On the way, Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> chanced to look at
me. Without warning he shoved me toward a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
snow bank, and thrust a handful of snow into my
face, rubbing it in hastily. My nose and cheeks were
freezing, and I did not know it. But before we
reached the <i>sobrania</i> I was chilled to the marrow,
and shook so hard after I had sat down at a table,
that the dishes rattled. My teeth chattered for a
couple of hours, and my shivers were so violent that
I had difficulty in drinking the hot tea I ordered.
In fact, I shivered violently for two days and nights,
though I sat nearly all day in the <i>sobrania</i> restaurant
with my back against a slightly warm wall-stove.</p>

<p>We spent the night once more in the colonel&#8217;s car,
but were up before daylight in order to begin our
offensive for space in the next Vladivostok train.
With Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> and Werkstein, I ran down
the whole length of the train as it arrived in the
terribly cold morning with only the light from the
frozen stars, seeking for the best cars. We identified
the steel cars from the wooden ones by their
coats of hoar frost.</p>

<p>The great mob in the station surged out and
attacked the train before the sleepy passengers
began to get off with their baggage. Immediately
there was a terrific jam.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_250a"><img src="images/i_250a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SOME AMERICAN RAILROAD MEN OF THE &#8220;RUSSIAN<br /> RAILWAY SERVICE&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Page_250b"><img src="images/i_250b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">WASHING CLOTHES IN SIXTY-BELOW-ZERO WEATHER</p>

<p>We fought our way into a car, inch by inch,
shouldering through the disembarking passengers
and clambering over their bundles and bales. The
first compartment we could get into was still full of
sleepily-protesting passengers, six being jammed into
a compartment designed to hold four. The place
was in a filthy condition, floors, berths, and window-ledges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
being covered with food refuse, cigarette
stubs, dirty papers, candle-wax, mud which had
melted out of ice tracked in at various stations. The
single guttering candle revealed it to be in a condition
worse than a pig-sty.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will hold this,&#8221; said Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span> &#8220;You
remain here and I will see the provodnik and pay
him to clean it, and see that it is locked. Then we
will move our baggage in.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned presently, having given the provodnik
twenty rubles for cleaning, and surety of possession.
I suggested that my orderly be left to hold it
against the mob already swarming in and thrusting
the door open as they passed to look in. Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> said that it was safe enough, and that we
would breakfast at the station while the coup&eacute; was
being cleaned, when we would begin moving our
baggage. I doubted the safety of this move, but as
he was running things and asserted that the station
master was a friend, I felt assured that he was right.</p>

<p>After breakfast, still before dawn, I sent my
orderly to get our tickets. He came back saying that
the line was so long that he could not get to the
window. Inquiry developed the fact that I could get
a military pass by seeing the Czech officer in charge
of transportation. We found him far up the railroad
yard in a third-class car, with a lot of his soldiers
eating their breakfast. He sat on a shelf and
scribbled a pass.</p>

<p>Now our baggage must be moved to the coup&eacute; we
had set aside in the Vladivostok train. I left my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
orderly to look after the transfer with the aid of a
hired porter, and hastened to the compartment we
had chosen.</p>

<p>On the way through the crowd I met Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> who went with me. We found the car a
seething mass of humanity, struggling with their
boxes in the corridor, and making a fight to gain
entrance to every coup&eacute; which had been pre&euml;mpted
by the earliest, luckiest and strongest of the
travellers.</p>

<p>To our surprise we found the coup&eacute; which we had
hired cleaned, full. There was a burly Russian soldier,
a Japanese officer, and a pair of Russian civilian
speculators lying in the berths, and the whole
place was crammed with baggage. They protested
wildly at supposed intrusion.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;,</span> being in Russian uniform overcoat
with gold shoulder straps, informed them all
that they must get out, as he had reserved the coup&eacute;.
This met with violent opposition as the party inside
was well settled.</p>

<p>Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> called for the provodnik, and as
that worthy could or would not come, he seized the
baggage nearest at hand and began pitching it out on
the heads of those in the corridor.</p>

<p>I managed to get a window open, and he pitched
bags and grips out on the mob outside. The effect
was magical. Our squatters needed their personal
effects more than they wanted the coup&eacute;, and they
dashed out to salvage their things, expressing themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
in Russian and Japanese as not at all admirers
of Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;.</span></p>

<p>I was left holding the fort. Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
hunted up the provodnik, and with a few properly
placed kicks, induced him to once more clean the
coup&eacute;. He tearfully announced that there was no
outside lock on the door.</p>

<p>Finally, we got our baggage in after a lot of
labor and fighting, and never left that coup&eacute; unguarded
for a minute the next three days on the way
to Vladivostok.</p>

<p>Late one night the Russian conductor managed to
get in on the plea that he wanted to see our tickets.
He at once announced that he was going to put two
more passengers in the coup&eacute;, and that the lower
berths would have to be shared, despite the fact that
it was plain there was barely room for us to get in
or out, or to turn round once inside. Captain <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span>
referred him to me telling him that the coup&eacute; was
reserved for an American officer, and that he himself
had nothing to do with the matter. I lifted myself
on one elbow, and reached for my pistol holster.
The conductor and his two villainous passengers
faded away, and presently we heard a rumpus in the
next coup&eacute;, where the two men were installed over
the protests of some women.</p>

<p>Of course, the conductor probably got a thousand
rubles to provide quarters for the two men, whether
they had tickets or not, as the speculators pay well
for accommodation. They made themselves so obnoxious
in the coup&eacute; which they got into that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
women occupants were forced to get off the train at
the next station and wait twenty-four hours for the
next train.</p>

<p>At every station we were besieged by incoming
passengers, who would thrust the door of the coup&eacute;
open and insist that they be allowed to enter, and
when we refused, they made insulting remarks.
Then they camped on their baggage outside the door
and sang ribald songs all night, or thrust burning
cigarettes through the aperture we left for air by
opening the door an inch and keeping the chain on.
Or they took occasion to block us in the passage if
we attempted to leave the coup&eacute;.</p>

<p>In order to allow Mrs. <span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> to leave the coup&eacute;,
I had to carry my pistol in my hand ahead of her,
and wait for her to come back. And while the three
of us got off at stations for tea, my orderly was left
with his automatic in his hand to keep off all comers.
We never pointed a gun at anybody, but having it in
hand, it prevented burly Manchus, Russians and
others from insisting that they had a right to
come in.</p>

<p>At one station down the line where we were to get
coal for our engine, we were delayed several hours
because there was no coal. The mine was not far
away, but with typical Siberian procrastination, the
coal was allowed to run short at the station. When a
train arrived which needed coal, it was time enough
to order an engine and a dozen coal cars to proceed
to the mine, load up, and return with a supply. So
we lay in the yards, and kept other trains at other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
stations waiting, till we had coaled and released traffic
in both directions. The branch line running to the
mine could have kept the coal yards full, with a
switch engine and one coal-car, but that would require
planning ahead, and doing something before it
was actually necessary to do it.</p>

<p>At another station, we waited five hours to change
a hot &#8220;brass&#8221; on a journal. This job at home takes
some ten minutes. As I watched a poor Chinese
mechanic scraping the bearing in forty-below
weather, using a primitive tool, I realized that the
&#8220;hordes of cheap labor in Asia&#8221; need not worry us
at home. This mechanic would put the semi-cylindrical
bearing into the journal-box and take it out.
Where it showed oil stains, the metal had to be
scraped away to get a good fit for the bearing. He
always scraped too much off where the oil showed it
to be ill-fitting, and of course, when he put it in
again, oil revealed that the spots which he had not
scraped, now stuck up. So he scraped these spots
away and repeated the process.</p>

<p>We were held up one night at a tiny telegraph
station on the plains. After six hours wait, Captain
<span class="nobr">B&mdash;&mdash;</span> and I attempted to ascertain when we might
expect to go on. We learned that there was a wreck
two versts ahead. There were two cars off the track&mdash;freight
cars. It developed later that the reason
we had to wait so long to get two freight cars off
the track, was due to the fact that some cases containing
books had been smashed in the wreck, and
the books scattered along the line. Before that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
freight train would come in, these cases had to be
repacked and renailed till they presented their original
appearance as near as it was possible to make
them, by Siberian railroad men working with a single
old lantern which burned lard-oil. While they tinkered
with cases of books in semi-darkness, the train
for Vladivostok, and all other traffic for miles in
both directions, were held nearly all night. Fancy
an American passenger train held till smashed cases
of freight could be rebuilt and repacked!</p>

<p>We got into Vladivostok three days late. The
transport in which I should have sailed for home
departed the day before I arrived. And a notice in
headquarters warned me not to go near the Trans-Siberian
station because there were many cases of
typhus among the refugees sleeping in the corridors!
It is needless to state that I calmly went there for
my baggage without worrying about typhus after
living so many days in trains and stations reeking
with typhus and other diseases. But one gets very
finicky living at headquarters. Incidentally, there
was a lot of tiger hunting done on the stairs of headquarters
at Vladivostok. The whole staff became
inveterate tiger hunters, and remained so, till a big
Siberian tiger came down near Vladivostok and
killed a bull and ate it.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of February, 1919, I was aboard
the Russian steamer <i>Simbirsk</i> when it pushed out
through the ice in the bay. But I was not yet out of
Siberia. The stewards never cleaned our rooms or
made up our berths, the ship still had the same old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Siberian smell, the decks and carpets in salon and
passage-ways remained consistently filthy, and we
had to put to sea without an adequate supply of
fresh water.</p>

<p>In two days I reached Tsuruga, Japan, went to
Yokohama by train, and caught the <i>Tenyo Maru</i> for
San Francisco. When ashore in Japan, I found once
more that the world was going on in its old way&mdash;trunks
could be checked, tickets purchased which insured
the right to a seat in a train, beds were clean,
food came soon after being ordered. I felt as if
I had escaped from an insane asylum. I had had
enough of Bolshevism to last me the rest of my life.
And I suggest that when any men or women develop
a leaning for Bolshevism in this country, that
they be shipped to Siberia. The trip will kill or cure.</p>

<small>THE PEASANTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> problem of Siberia is the peasant-minded
population. I use this term to avoid confusion with
what is the popular conception of &#8220;peasant,&#8221; that is,
a tiller of the soil, a rude and ignorant farmer or
farm-hand, the human being described in Russian as
&#8220;<i>moujik</i>.&#8221; The mass of the people is peasant-minded,
whether working in cities or in the wilderness.
The fact that those in the cities have acquired
urban characteristics, does not to my mind prevent
them from having mental calibers on a par with the
rural population when it comes to knowledge of government,
or minds revealing any alertness toward
new ideas or reaction to anything with which they
are unfamiliar. This vast population appears to be
mentally static.</p>

<p>The stupidity of these people never ceases to
amaze Americans. Many of our soldiers who were
Russians and had been for years in the United
States, apparently must make a great mental effort
to comply with the simplest request. Their brains
seem to be congealed. And the Siberian, asked a
simple question in his own language by one speaking
Russian perfectly, acts like a man rousing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
from deep slumber before he can comprehend the
question, much less answer it.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Russia has been gained from
two sources&mdash;histories and books on government
telling us of official and court life, and the Russian
novelists. One class of writer deals with a few exalted
personages, the other class tells us of the
common people. Really, there is no history of Russia,
for such history as we have concerns the figures
of the Imperial dynasties and their satellites. Reading
this, is something like attempting to get the
history of the United States by being able to read
only scenes from meetings of the cabinets of our
presidents, and personal gossip about the characters
of notable people, and how they acted in times of
national stress.</p>

<p>Now I believe that Tolstoy, Gorky and other Russian
novelists, did the Russian peasant more damage
than all the Czars. They did not reveal the peasant
to us, despite their brilliancy as novelists. They
idealized the peasant. They built up a great illusion.
I am not saying that after six months in Siberia I
know more about the Siberian peasant than the
novelists, but I am saying that they did not tell us the
things we should know about him. They made the
outer world believe that the peasant, once free of the
Czars, would throw off his chrysalis of tyranny and
emerge as a beautiful creature, living a life of sobriety,
industry, and good behavior.</p>

<p>These novelists led us to believe that freedom in
Russia was a matter of legislation, emanating from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
the halls of the Duma; they led us to believe that
imperial bureaucracy was responsible for the woes
of the people, when as a matter of fact, the people
were responsible for that very imperial bureaucracy.
We were led to believe that a machine-gun government
would transform itself into a printing-press
government once the old r&eacute;gime was shattered. We
saw it shattered&mdash;and the vast Empire became a
shambles.</p>

<p>Freedom is in the hearts of a people, and not in
legislative halls. The congress of a nation is but an
expression of the freedom which the people feel in
their hearts&mdash;the machine, but not the fuel which
drives it. It is futile to send representatives of the
people to a congress if the people do not know what
they want to express. It results only in autocracy, in
exploitation. If a law-maker finds that he gets as
much credit for making a bad law as he gets for
making a good law, neither law being understood,
he soon disregards the people and works for his own
ends, thus usurping power which has not been delegated
to him. He becomes master instead of servant.
People are responsible for their government.</p>

<p>A wave of joy swept the United States when the
news came that the Czar had fallen. We had a
mental picture of two hundred million human beings
able now to enjoy a liberty similar to our own. It
was a great emancipation.</p>

<p>I believe it will take several hundred years before
the mass of the people of Russia will have attained
a mental capacity on a par with the civilization which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
we know. They are still in the dim twilight of
medieval times, though they are playing with
modern machinery.</p>

<p>And when it comes to turning such a nation from
an absolute autocracy into a liberal republic, in
which one man&#8217;s vote is as good as another&#8217;s, it is
impossible without the element of time. A country
so vast and so various, with the blood of so many
nations running through the people, and especially
a people holding the Asiatic viewpoint of government,
cannot be administered immediately according
to our ideal. The best that can be hoped for is a
constitutional monarchy, and even if that form of
government is gained, it will be for some time a
dictatorship.</p>

<p>I am forced to this conclusion. All the pity, all
the sympathy we may feel for this benighted people,
will not alter the facts. We cannot swing a magician&#8217;s
wand and hand freedom to these people on a
silver salver. We have got to face facts, and realize
that the Tolstoys and Gorkys have misled us about
the Russian peasant. For once given a free hand,
this sublimated peasant has produced a tragedy,
with himself the victim, which outdoes any tragedy
the human race has ever wished itself into.</p>

<p>The peasant has been described by Russian novelists
as &#8220;inscrutable,&#8221; the inference being that behind
the &#8220;dreamy eyes&#8221; and simple expressions on the
faces of these people there were deep thoughts and
a yearning for an ideal existence&mdash;some mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
greatness which if we could once understand it,
would reveal to us a wonderful race.</p>

<p>I consider this inscrutability to be of the same
quality which exists in the eyes of a simple old cow,
which being invited into the parlor and turned loose,
kicks the walls out of the building and dies under
the wreckage of the roof. It is an ignorance deeper
than we of the United States are capable of comprehending&mdash;a
childish mentality in a white person who
appears good-natured, religious, kind and hospitable
under a restraining government, but who will kill his
neighbor simply for the purpose of doing something
dramatic.</p>

<p>It may be charged that my pessimism on the peasant
is exaggerated, and that the Russian in this country
disproves my assertions that hundreds of years
must elapse before the peasant can meet our standards
of intelligence. What the Russian peasant does
in this country has nothing to do with the case except
to show that removed from Russia he forges ahead.
But the Russian who comes here is of a higher type
than those of his fellows he leaves behind&mdash;he must
be energetic, ambitious, adventurous, aspiring to better
things to take the trip of his own initiative and
to have acquired by himself passage-money. If he
gets aid from relatives already here in order to make
the journey, there are members of his family who
have shown ability in getting ahead. If he is compelled
to escape from his country, that fact indicates
that he was not satisfied with his lot at home&mdash;he is
not given to dumb submission.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>But we cannot import to this country all the
peasants in the Russian Empire in order to advance
their education to our standards. Their future is in
their own hands, no matter how much we may
attempt to aid them. And my pessimism toward the
peasant is primarily an attitude toward him as he
exists in his native environment. I am not attempting
to judge him by our standards. I am attempting
to show him in such a light that our people will give
up attempting to judge him by our standards, so long
as he remains at home.</p>

<p>We must stop considering Russia and Siberia as
filled with people much like ourselves. They must
be considered from an entirely new angle&mdash;much as
if they were people of another planet. In fact, that
has been and is our difficulty with all Asia. And
when I say Asia, I do not mean so much a place, as
I mean a state of mind.</p>

<p>The question may be raised as to why we should
consider the peasant seriously. We do not have to if
we do not want to, but we should, for what happens
in Russia during the next decade or two will have
serious effects upon us, our national existence, and
the future of our children. I do not mean this in a
sense of what they may do to us, but in the sense of
what they may do with themselves. What has happened
in Siberia and all Russia during the last couple
of years has alarmed us. The happenings were the
result partly of our belief in the last fifty years, that
what happened in Russia was no concern of ours.
We have suddenly awakened to the fact that injustice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
and intrigue and a weak monarch on the other
side of the world, can have a most decided effect
upon us. We got a good deal of amusement out of
Wilhelm of Germany and his &#8220;mailed fist&#8221; and
&#8220;shining armor&#8221;&mdash;it was all a merry show to us.
We are just beginning to pay the piper. We have
had a demonstration that what foreign princes may
do is decidedly our business. We may not have
learned the lesson fully.</p>

<p>It is apparent that Bolshevism made a powerful
appeal to the peasants of Siberia, as it did to the submerged
class of all Russia. The readiness with
which these benighted people took up a saturnalia of
crime in order to right certain crimes which had been
committed against them, startled the world. The
universality of Bolshevism in Russia actually led
many people of peasant-minds here and abroad, to
suspect that there was something good behind it all&mdash;it
was hard to believe that a nation of two
hundred million human beings supposedly civilized,
could be so utterly wrong.</p>

<p>And while Bolshevism was wrecking a vast nation,
it seemed impossible to get any definite idea of what
it was, and what it intended to do. Many of our
people are still in that frame of mind, despite the fact
that a nation has been wrecked. There are charges
and counter-charges, accusations and denials, and all
the while wholesale murder is going on. People at
home, supposed to have brains, still argue that Bolshevism
is a good thing, a just thing, and the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
justice in government that there is. They have not
seen the wreckage.</p>

<p>There are others who have seen the wreckage,
but are so enamored of a theory which they have
upheld, that they will not admit the terrible things
they have seen because these things would prove
them and their theory to be wrong. These people
could look at a train wreck in which a hundred persons
were killed, and say: &#8220;There is nothing to
worry about. This all means that we will build
better cars and use safety devices. And if we don&#8217;t
like the color of the new cars, we will wreck the
trains till we get equipment that suits us. It is necessary
that people die in order to have cars which
meet our tastes in colors. What happens to the passengers
does not worry us&mdash;we have theories of railroading
which must be carried out, even if in testing
them everybody in the country is killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The arguments of the Bolshevist leaders made
headway with the peasants because the basis of Bolshevism
is class-war. Bolshevism is founded on
the fallacy that it is the ability of the lower class
which is exploited, when it is the ignorance of the
lower class which is exploited. And the Bolshevist
leaders have exploited this ignorance in a more
terrible way than ever the ruling class did under
the old r&eacute;gime.</p>

<p>The ignorance, credulity, stupidity and cruelty of
the Siberian peasant passes our understanding. And
in passing judgment upon these forlorn people, who
filled me with disgust by their willingness to be dirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
when it would be as easy to be clean, and in stressing
their revolting aspects, my purpose is to bring
home to the reader a clearer appreciation of the
problems which face us when we attempt to aid
them. I believe that I am helping them in depicting
them to the generous-minded people of the
United States and other countries.</p>

<p>We cannot leave them alone, even if we would.
The point I want to make is that all our agencies for
welfare work, all our machinery of government which
takes up the Siberian and Russian problem, must
realize the difficulties ahead and understand that the
problem differs from any other problem we have
ever attacked. It is Asia, white man&#8217;s Asia. Despite
white skin, we have on our hands a race not
akin to white, yellow or black. We readjust our
minds when we come to deal with the colored races.
We must readjust our minds when we deal with the
Siberian, and keep that readjustment steadily, for
the Siberian does not constantly warn us by the color
of his face that his mind presents to us a barrier
against mutual understanding. We must learn about
him, as he must learn about us. Centuries of serfdom,
centuries of autocratic rule, centuries of cruelty,
have left their imprint on his brain. &#8220;Half devil
and half child&#8221; was written of the black races. It is
also a good thing to keep in mind when we consider
Siberia.</p>

<p>The more the peasant disgusted me, the more I
pitied him. We may say that the drowning man
who reaches up and catches the gunwale of a life-boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
full of women and children and upsets it in his
frantic efforts to save himself, is a fool. Yet we
must realize that he is responding to the natural
instinct of self-preservation. He knows decidedly
that he is in danger of death, his brain is not working
normally, and his greatest impulse is to save himself&mdash;all
idea of sacrificing himself for the benefit
of the majority or the helpless, have been swamped
by unreasoning fear.</p>

<p>The Siberian peasant knew something was wrong
when he was prevented from having the soil. He
loves the soil, and he loves to make it produce.
He and his forbears have been in the clutches of a
governmental system so asinine as to thwart him in
his desire to work the land. He endured this serfdom
in fact, for ages, he endured serfdom under
another guise since official serfdom has been abolished.
Instigated and aided by the Bolshevists, who
were in turn backed by Germany, he wrecked the
government of his oppressors, and finds himself
caught in the wreckage. If the thing works out in
the way Germany hopes, the peasant stands simply to
change masters.</p>

<p>The peasant has been glorified by the Russian
novelists for his quality of endurance, rather than
for his accomplishments. His submission was extolled,
and we gave his submission a wrong valuation.
We pitied him, and he became a martyr in
our eyes, with all the virtues that go with martyrdom.
Freed of his chains, he mistook license for
liberty, and we were shocked to find that he whom we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
regarded as a kind man who had been wronged,
could only emulate his late masters in cruelty, murder
and injustice to his own kind.</p>

<p>It may be said that the people of Siberia, being
the rudest of Russians, are not at all typical, and
that as the Siberians are the descendants of exiles,
or former exiles, they have experienced a degeneration
which prevents them from being representative
of the corresponding class in European Russia.
There may be something in that idea.</p>

<p>And I grant that judging the people of Siberia
during a revolution, may be like judging the people
of San Francisco while they were camping among
the ruins of their city after the earthquake&mdash;that
conditions were abnormal, and reduced to a primitive
state.</p>

<p>But if people seem to prefer being filthy to being
clean, when the desirable condition calls for but little
effort, it is obvious that in normal times, they were
inherently filthy. And I experienced filth, day after
day, in trains, railway restaurants and hotels, which
I cannot hint at, much less describe. Sanitation is
the beginning of civilization. When conductors on
trains, and passengers on trains, will create and permit
without protest, a condition of squalor and unsanitary
conditions such as I saw, and which the wildest
animal avoids, there is something wrong mentally
with such a people. And when a suggestion that conditions
might be improved is met by a stare of amazement
that anyone should find these things revolting,
one begins to wonder if government by a knout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
was not actually needed. But we know that the
knout, censorship, repression, and the barriers
against outside ideas and education are responsible
for these conditions. These people are victims of a
government that was criminal.</p>

<p>While observing the peasants, and while discussing
them in this book, I have tried to keep an open
mind. I have not hesitated to reveal their worst side.
I am willing to bring out in full force their exasperating
habits of dilatoriness, their slow mental
and physical gear which we describe as laziness, that
we may realize their problem, and our problem in
aiding them.</p>

<p>There is another side to the shield. It is my
opinion that the only hope which Russia has for regeneration,
no matter how long it may take to do
the work, lies in the peasant class. Not the actual
stolid peasant, but in men and women from the
peasant class. That is the difference and distinction
in my whole statement. Breshkovsky, &#8220;Grandmother
of the Revolution&#8221; is of the peasant class,
but not peasant-minded.</p>

<p>There are among the millions of peasants in Russia,
men and women who are beyond their class in
mental attainments. That ability may be latent,
but it will rise to the top as surely as water seeks
its own level. This quality of genius runs through
the whole human race in all lands.</p>

<p>The genius of Russia under the old r&eacute;gime could
only express itself in protest against government,
which was the biggest job at hand for the genius.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
And this expression frequently came in the form of
literature. When Tolstoy and Gorky extolled the
peasant, one a noble and the other a commoner, both
were merely praying that the latent genius in a few
individuals have a fair chance to come to flower.
They were fighting oppression, though they gave us
an idea that if the peasants all had a chance, all
would reveal the quality of genius. That hope is
absurd, in Russia or elsewhere. What we want,
in Russia and at home, is that the peasant-minded
people have comfort and justice though they persist
in remaining peasant-minded, and that when an
individual reveals extraordinary ability, he may develop
it, and not be broken on the wheel for daring
to lift himself out of the rut.</p>

<p>My ideal is not a nation of peasants by any means.
But I do insist that a large mass of our own population
prefers to be peasant-minded, and fights
against being anything else. There is but a small
proportion of our population which demands art in
literature, pictures, or anything else. There is a
mental Bolshevism all about us at home. There is a
clearly defined hostility against mental accomplishments,
expressed in many newspaper cartoons, in fiction,
and in the utterances of demagogues. Our
small-town hoodlum who resents the well-dressed
stranger as a &#8220;dude,&#8221; and despises good grammar
and evidences of an education, is at heart a Bolshevist&mdash;he
is hostile to the &#8220;upper class&#8221; just as is the
Siberian peasant. The man in the motor car, who
has no consideration for the pedestrian, is at heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
a Cossack. Both classes are in a dangerous frame
of mind.</p>

<p>Here at home we urge our young folks to get educations.
Then we joke about the college professors
who get less in wages than laborers. We all like
to see labor well-paid, but while teachers get starvation
wages, we cannot consistently argue the value
of education. The college professor may say he
gets more out of life than the laborer&mdash;what the
laborer says to his children is the thing we must
consider. We must be careful that we do not build
up a class-war based on an ignorance which has no
ideas of relative values, which is the trouble in Siberia.
The Bolshevists turned the janitor of a college
into president of the college, and made the
president do duty as janitor. Without hatred for
education, the Siberians could not do such a thing.</p>

<p>When I assert that the salvation of Russia lies in
the hands of the peasant class, I mean the peasant
who has brains and wants to develop them, not the
peasant who wants to kill everybody wearing a white
collar. I do not mean that Russia should be led by
the professional agitator or the demagogue, or the
silk-stockinged revolutionist, but men who spring
from the people and have the balance of sanity.</p>

<p>Russia will develop its own Lincoln; but before
that time, I believe it will have a national Napoleon.
The latter will do it a service by first co&ouml;rdinating
and stabilizing the national spirit, and bringing the
shattered remnants of the vast land under one government.
That is the only kind of ruler the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
will understand and obey now. If they had to-day
an ideal president directing the country under an
ideal form of government, he would probably be
sacrificed by the warring factions before he could
get his program of regeneration under way.</p>

<p>We must bear in mind the fact that the mass of
the Russian people got their official freedom in the
days of our Civil War, and their actual freedom as
recently as when the Czar&#8217;s government was overthrown.
They do not know what to do with it yet.
They are literal minded, and when we speak to them
of equality in rights and of opportunity, they interpret
it to mean equality in all things&mdash;one man
as good as another, one man as wise as another,
one man as rich as another. They do not understand
political equality. To disagree with them is
fatal if they have the power to kill.</p>

<p>We have people at home, who have lived for
years under our form of government, who do not
yet grasp our meaning of liberty and freedom. We
cannot expect the Siberians to grasp the principles
of republican government over night. They have
had no demonstration of our system of government,
and they find some of their own people who have
experienced our system of government, going back
to Siberia to slander us. They go back with the
cry that they were exploited here, in our mills and
packing-houses. Their ignorance was exploited, and
our government is blamed. They assert that their
ability was exploited. They do not realize that in
confessing that they were exploited, they are admitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
ignorance. That may not excuse their exploitation,
but it accounts for it.</p>

<p>One of my Russian orderlies, who had been in
this country some ten years, first as a steel worker
in Pittsburgh, and then as a barber, told me how he
had finally induced his brother to come to America
and work. So he sent his brother passage-money.
The brother got aboard a ship for America&mdash;and
found himself practically sold into slavery in the
Argentine, where he worked more than a year for
miserable food and quarters. By that time he had
been located by his brother of Pittsburgh, who sent
passage-money to come to New York and fare to
Pittsburgh. But he got aboard a ship for Russia,
having had enough of &#8220;America.&#8221; He was killed
as a Russian soldier in the war against Germany.
He told everybody in his home town what a terrible
place America was. The United States was blamed
because he could not get here when his ticket was
purchased for him&mdash;so far as he was concerned, life
as a peon in a turpentine camp in the Argentine represented
labor conditions in the United States. He
never could be made to understand that Argentina
was not the United States. It was all &#8220;America.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same way, immigrants from Russia have
been lured to Russian boarding houses in this country,
stripped of their little cash and few belongings,
and turned adrift. They blame the United States,
when it was their own countrymen who robbed them.
Their ignorance was being exploited.</p>

<p>We at home hear that the Trans-Siberian Railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
is running. So are our transcontinental lines.
A railroad is a railroad, to us. In Siberia, however,
it took me ten days to go by rail a distance that
would take ten hours at home. There I traveled
in what we would consider a fairly good cattle-car;
here I moved in a palace on wheels. There, I was
glad to pay a dollar for a bowl of greasy cabbage
soup; here, I got a complete meal served in luxurious
surroundings, for a dollar.</p>

<p>These are some of the reasons why we require
a mental readjustment when we think of Siberia.
It is impossible to use the same terms and convey
the same idea. And these differences in usual things
and usual terms, explain the difficulty we have had
in visualizing and understanding Bolshevism. We
think of a theory at home; in Siberia we see the result
of the theory.</p>

<p>Returning home I heard a man in the Twentieth
Century Limited explaining some of the virtues of
Bolshevism. He had never been in Siberia. Our
train was moving nearly sixty miles an hour, and we
were clean and comfortable, plenty of food at hand.
As this man talked, I smiled in remembrance of an
engineer in Siberia who had demanded a bottle of
vodka before he would haul our train any farther&mdash;and
when he got it, proceeded to get drunk and let
his train almost run away during the night as it descended
a steep grade in the Khingan Mountain
range.</p>

<p>I wondered if the passenger in the Twentieth Century,
who extolled the virtues of Bolshevism, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
have been willing to ride in the Twentieth Century
any longer if our engineer had suddenly stopped and
demanded a bottle of whiskey before he proceeded.
That would have been Bolshevism in fact. It was
easy to theorize in safety with a sober engineer at
the throttle. A Bolshevist at the throttle of government
may make a good engineer, to hear our boudoir
Bolshevists talk. I observe a strange reluctance
on their part to go to Russia where Bolshevism
is running things.</p>

<p>To me, the horror of the peasant in Siberia, was
the realization that his children and grandchildren
had little hope to be better off. I do not mean that
the old r&eacute;gime will come back with all its terrors;
but no matter what form of government may flourish
in Petrograd, it will be many years before the
leaven of the most enlightened rule can penetrate the
minds of these people and bring to the surface such
good qualities as are deeply imbedded in their brains,
sealed up under layers of ignorance, superstition,
and submission.</p>

<p>They believe we are not there to help them, but to
protect our own investments. We are losing their
confidence every day that we remain in Siberia without
doing something constructive, in which they have
understanding. If we want to do welfare work, do
it, but without an expedition on the ground; if we
want to use our troops in cleaning up the Bolshevists,
get into action. They will understand either activity
by itself but they cannot understand military occupation
without action, and they cannot understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
relief work carried on under inactive bayonets. We
have talked too much about our friendship for Russia,
and done little or nothing to aid the country in
re&euml;stablishing itself with a government.</p>

<p>Whatever assurance we may give Kolchak, or
other leaders, that we will back them up, we will
gain little unless our actions win the confidence of
the peasant masses, and the so-called &#8220;workers.&#8221;
I group them together.</p>

<p>The mass of the people of Siberia lean more toward
Bolshevism than they do toward us. Not that
they are actively Bolshevist, but they have in the
backs of their heads a secret love for the theory,
for it promises them a chance to get rich quick. All
ignorant people have a strong tendency to greed&mdash;they
want to take from those who have. That is
all Bolshevism is, and that is why I maintain that
the masses are largely Bolshevist in their sympathies.</p>

<p>The longer we hesitate, the longer we take to
reach a decision, the more these masses are slipping
away from us. The crisis will come in the winter
of 1920, because the people were Bolshevist in their
tendencies with fairly good food supplies. They will
turn to Bolshevism wholly, in order to force us into
feeding them, if crops have been scanty and the food
reserve has been consumed. They do not appear
to be yet ready to settle down to steady and regular
work, because they have not been assured that
their earnings or accumulations will be protected
for them by a decent government.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>We have failed to do much in nearly a year of
occupation, and they have done less because they
were waiting for our lead. They had no real grievance
when they objected to our presence in the country
last winter. They will have a grievance if things
do not suit them next winter, for they will say: &#8220;You
told us you were going to help. We waited for you
to help, and now we are in misery. It is your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must remember that we are dealing with a
people who not only may become Bolshevists, but a
people who have been Bolshevists, and rather liked
it. They will get at it again if we do not watch out.
So far, we have done little or nothing to gain either
their friendship, or their wholesome respect for our
military powers. And they are being whispered to
all the time by influences which know how to make
them react to certain ideas.</p>

<p>What have the Allies done in Siberia, except to
control the Trans-Siberian Railroad? Our relief
work was discredited by the peasants on the plea that
we were giving them things in order to get them off
their guard, induce them to be good, and grab their
railroad. They asserted that we were trying to
bribe the Bolshevists into being good, and that the
Bolshevists would as soon get property from the
capitalists by having it given to them as by taking
it. We cannot expect to subsidize Bolshevism by
those methods, for the more we give, the more they
will demand. It is the old game of paying tribute
to bandits so they will not rob your caravans&mdash;a
scheme as old to Asia as the Arabian Nights tales.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>If we are going to remain in Siberia, we must
back some horse. We must either go against the
peasants and compel them to behave, or we must
go in with them on some basis they will understand.
We have been dealing with big fellows, believing
that the &#8220;leaders&#8221; knew what to do, yet we have
not supported any of the &#8220;leaders.&#8221; Throw in with
Kolchak and back him up, regardless of monarchist
intrigues, and then if he attempts to betray us and
Russia, denounce him, and back such leader as is
willing to carry out what we suppose to be the wishes
of the people.</p>

<p>But if we think that we can follow the wishes of
the people, we will make a mistake. That is the
mistake we have made already. We have been waiting
for Russian &#8220;public opinion&#8221; to coagulate. It
cannot be done. There are a thousand Russian
&#8220;public opinions.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have got to follow our own public opinion
as to what should be done, with consistency to our
ideals of government, and then go ahead. There
will be factions in Siberia and Russia who will object,
because the people do not know what they want.
They believe they are free, and that freedom means
doing as they please. As a matter of fact, they
abhor any government which attempts to control
them. It has taken us twenty years in the Philippines
to prove to the Filipinos, a people composed of
various tribes, that we are working for their good.
Some of the &#8220;leaders&#8221; want a freer hand in leading
than they get. I doubt if we want to take on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
same problem in Russia, I doubt if it is necessary.
But we have not told any Russians at present writing
what we intend to do for them, if anything.</p>

<p>The peasants cannot read their daily newspapers
in order to form opinions. They can only believe
what they are told, so what they believe depends
upon who does the telling. And in Siberia one will
believe anything. I myself, after three weeks without
news, gave credence to absurd rumors.</p>

<p>Actions speak louder than words with the peasants
of Siberia. We have been long on promises
and short on deeds&mdash;at least deeds which the peasants
can understand. We declined to act with the
Japanese against &#8220;agitating peasants.&#8221; Neither the
Japanese nor the Siberians could understand what
we were driving at. Both understood our troops to
represent force to be used against disorder. We
maintained that our force was not to interfere with
anything the Siberians wished to do with their own
country. So the &#8220;agitating peasants&#8221; began to interfere
with us, and we have killed and wounded in
our casualty lists from Siberia. We wished to avoid
killing any Siberians. They reasoned that we must
be in the wrong by being there at all, and killed
Americans. This indicates that we have not made
the proper impression on the peasants. The problem
of Siberia is the peasant, and we ignore him&mdash;at
least we do not consider how he will react to
what we do. He fears that we will betray him.
It is much more likely that, as we are conducting
ourselves in Siberia, he will betray us.</p>

<small>FRENZIED FINANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Siberia</span> is the land of Aladdins&mdash;Aladdins who
can laugh at lamps so long as they possess money-printing
machines. The German General Staff was
the Magician who craftily suggested the use of the
machines. And those first sponsors of Bolshevism,
who were the creatures of the Magician, were the
terrible jinns who gave their services to the financial
wrecking of Great Russia, including Siberia.
Said the Magician, &#8220;What you Russians want is
land and money. There lies the land. Take it! As
for money, print it!&#8221; So the Aladdins, instead of
rubbing lamps, oiled up the printing-presses. And,
presto&mdash;millions of rubles!</p>

<p>Such a suggestion would have passed as a species
of light humor in any other country. Certainly it
would not have been acted upon. But the Magician
knew the child-like psychology of his Aladdins, for
to their simple minds, a ruble is any piece of paper
upon which the words &#8220;One Ruble&#8221; have been
printed. And such paper is made more attractive
than any genuine ruble if upon it is also engraved
some crude picture, preferably that of a working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
man resting from his labors and surveying rich fields
and bust factory chimneys.</p>

<p>First of all, the German Magician induced his
jinns to steal from the Russian Treasury the gold
which was behind the Imperial paper rubles&mdash;thus
depreciating the value of those rubles (but only to
those few who knew that the gold had gone to Germany).
Next, and with characteristic inconsistency,
the Bolshevists, while preaching a crusade against
money,&mdash;in other words, capitalism&mdash;proceeded to
print bales of money behind which they put no gold.
Then they used money as their chief weapon to fight
money!</p>

<p>From the standpoint of imagination, the whole
scheme put to shame the wildest, most gigantic get-rich-quick
dream ever born in the brain of a mortal.
Those bales of stage money dramatized the cash
wealth of the Bolshevists&mdash;actually visualized to
every peasant and worker the tangible success of
Bolshevism. Further, the Bolshevists, through their
keen methods of distributing this wealth, were able
to convince a poverty-stricken people that Bolshevism
stood for everything that was generous and good.
Already the Bolshevists had taken over the government.
With pockets stuffed full of stage money, the
people massed themselves in the defense of that new
government.</p>

<p>If you have been desperately poor all your life,
and a man thrusts hundreds of dollars into your
hands to prove that he is your friend, you believe
him. If he says he stands for the government which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
is behind those dollars, are you not likely to range
yourself on the side of that government? And
should a stranger from the other end of the world
happen along and tell you that the fellow who had
made you wealthy is a crazy man, will that stranger
not need a pretty strong argument to win you away
from him who made you rich without labor?</p>

<p>This is precisely how the scheme was worked in
Siberia.</p>

<p>The Bolshevists carried out their program of winning
over the people with great subtlety&mdash;a subtlety
which suggests that the Magician was inspired of
the Devil. The method of procedure was as follows:
As the Bolshevist propagandists traveled by
trains eastward from Vladivostok, and westward
from Petrograd, they took with them chests and
sacks of purposely rumpled, soiled and worn currency.
Whenever they rolled into a station, they
would call, say, upon a <i>moujik</i> for some trifling service&mdash;perhaps
the filling of a tea-kettle with hot
water; and when the <i>moujik</i> returned with the kettle,
a Bolshevist would hand him five hundred one-ruble
bills!</p>

<p>To a <i>moujik</i>, five hundred rubles represents years
of hard work&mdash;it is a fortune. He stands and stares
at his fistful of money. &#8220;This poor traveler is surely
mad,&#8221; he concludes; &#8220;or he has made a terrible
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>But neither of these is the truth. It is astounding
enough&mdash;yet for the <i>moujik</i> not difficult to believe.
For like all his fellows, this peasant has lived his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
whole life in the expectation that some such wonderful
thing would happen when the Czar was pulled
from his throne. And now the passenger tells the
<i>moujik</i> that the money is all his. The miracle has
come to pass!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Bolshevist,&#8221; says the traveler. &#8220;Therefore
I am your friend. If a capitalist asks you to
fill his tea-kettle, what would he give you? Five
kopecks. I give you five hundred rubles. Comrade,
your country is behind this money. Look!
There are the fields and factories on the notes. The
capitalists have worked you hard and given you little:
I work you little and give you much. That is
because I am a Bolshevist. If you will be a Bolshevist
you will never want again. My brother, freedom
has come to Russia! Uphold the revolution!&#8221;</p>

<p>The secret of the success of this plan lay in the
fact that the miraculous conferring of wealth was
general. The waiters in the station restaurant received
a thousand rubles each for a bowl of cabbage
soup. Clerks in nearby shops were paid exorbitant
sums for various trifles. Drosky-drivers had their
belts filled with money. Bath-attendants packed their
tips away wrapped up in towels. In fact the whole
population of the town, even the beggars on the
street-corners, found that their pockets were bulging
when that train pulled out. And since practically
every one had the currency, there was no one
to say it was bad. Therefore, it was considered good&mdash;unanimously.</p>

<p>Just as simple as that! They hated capital, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
were glad to have it! Having it, they were Bolshevists.</p>

<p>You of the United States may laugh at all this.
But you must consider two things: First, the abysmal
ignorance of the Siberian peasantry; and, second,
that from the days of Aladdin, Asia has reeked
with legends of magic wealth. So you have a whole
people who, like that first <i>moujik</i>, are ready to credit
any story&mdash;especially a story backed by real money.
And the American, or other foreigner, who comes
along and says that that money is worthless, and
dares to laugh at it, may find himself facing a firing-squad.</p>

<p>When the Allies began to arrive in Siberia, and
the Bolshevist leaders found it convenient not to remain,
they naturally took their money-machines
with them. But this worked the new r&eacute;gime no
noticeable hardship. For the larger business concerns,
realizing the beauty of a plan which permitted
each firm to establish its own Treasury, began
to print their own currency. And there was a mad
riot of money manufacturing.</p>

<p>It was most profitable for the business houses&mdash;it
had its shortcomings for the public. For instance:
You drop in at the balconied &#8220;Zolotoi Roq&#8221; (this
restaurant has been dubbed the &#8220;Solitary Dog&#8221; by
the doughboy), and order your five o&#8217;clock <i>stakahn
chai</i>. The tea is served in a glass. Your cake is
about the size of a political campaign button. The
bill is four rubles. Being a newcomer to Vladivostok,
you hand out, unwisely, an Imperial twenty-ruble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
note. The waiter brings back sixteen rubles in
change. You count it, give him one, and fold the
other fifteen away&mdash;carefully.</p>

<p>Farther down the Svetlanskaya, which is the
Broadway of Vladivostok, you drop into a shop for
a new shaving-stick and a picture-postcard. &#8220;Four
rubles, <i>pshaltza</i>.&#8221; You fish out that fifteen rubles
from the &#8220;Zolotoi Roq&#8221; and offer four of them.
The clerk looks at the money, then lifts shoulders
and eyebrows. What is the matter? The rubles
are good only at the &#8220;Zolotoi Roq.&#8221; You demur.
But for you an argument in Russian is a fearsome
thing. &#8220;Oh, well, <i>nitchyvo</i>.&#8221; (You are acquiring
already the native frame of mind!) But as you have
no other small change,&mdash;you will grow wiser later!&mdash;out
comes another precious twenty-ruble Imperial.</p>

<p>And what do you get this time? Imperial roubles,
good elsewhere in town? <i>Niet!</i> You receive sixteen
exquisite new rubles which have just come off
the presses of that particular shop, and&mdash;they are
good only at that shop!</p>

<p>Being an officer, you are blessed with many pockets.
So now you plot out, as it were, your khaki
fa&ccedil;ade. The upstairs right hand, as Barrie would
say, becomes the Imperial pocket; the upstairs left,
is sacred to your American money; while the downstairs,
right and left, is given over respectively to
the &#8220;Zolotoi Roq&#8221; and the shaving-stick store. In
other words, you are a walking bank for at least
two establishments in that town. You are virtually
holding some of their money in escrow. You may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
have it, but eventually it will belong to them. And
it will be your fate to wear out your field boots carrying
that money back to the place of its redemption.
Yes, the light has dawned upon you&mdash;your lower
pockets are mortgaged!</p>

<p>It is probably at this point in your Siberian monetary
education that you wish on your soul that you
had brought along your own little printing-press!
(And you feel sure that you could have produced
better looking rubles than even General Horvat&#8217;s
American-made ones&mdash;with their pictures of a lightning
express.) But lacking the press, a supply of
cigar-store certificates from home would come in
handy. For you learn that the doughboys have already
successfully put into circulation the pink coupons
of a certain popular cigarette.</p>

<p>But the monetary problem in Vladivostok is comparatively
simple. This is borne in upon you when
you leave the city for the interior. (If you leave on
one of the innumerable Russian holidays, and all the
shops are shut up, you must overeat at the &#8220;Zolotoi
Roq&#8221; to get rid of that currency, but you must carry
with you the paper belonging to the closed shops.)
For once en route, you begin to acquire various
kinds of Bolshevist money. And some of this money
is good only in its particular zone. If you pass out
of that zone without knowing it, you find that money
worthless.</p>

<p>So travel through any single province is as complicated,
from the standpoint of money, as if you
had been passing through several different countries.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
Suppose the same conditions obtained in the United
States. In going from New York to Philadelphia,
you would have to get rid of your New York money
in exchange for Philadelphia money&mdash;if you could.
(Less discount for exchange.) When you reach
Trenton, you wish to buy a sandwich. But the vendor
will not take your Philadelphia money. So you
offer a coupon off a Liberty bond&mdash;value five dollars&mdash;and
receive in exchange some Trenton money,
good only in Trenton. It is either that or go without
the sandwich! If you travel as far as New
Orleans, you have eleven kinds of money, no one
kind of which has any value to you.</p>

<p>Returning from the Trans-Baikal, I saw a sick
man attempt to purchase a bottle of milk from farm
women who had set up a little market near the
Androvka station. The women were peasants. Their
heads were wrapped in old shawls. In the sixty-degrees-below-zero
temperature, their breath came
like plumes of white smoke from their nostrils. They
looked at the sick man&#8217;s money and folded their
arms, refusing to take it. &#8220;But it is good in
Nikolsk,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;Then go to Nikolsk and
spend it,&#8221; they returned. Shivering and hungry,
the sick man climbed back into the coup&eacute; of his car.
His pockets were full and his stomach was empty!
He was as helpless as old King Midas.</p>

<p>In Siberia, a country fairly underlaid with precious
metals&mdash;gold, silver, platinum and copper&mdash;there
is no metal money to be seen. In fact coins are
a curiosity, and even the beggar&#8217;s metal kopeck has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
disappeared. Where is this money? Hidden in the
niches between the logs of huts, buried under frozen
cabbages, sewed into ragged clothes. And anything
takes its place. In Chita, in the <i>sobrania</i>, or city
club, playing cards passed as currency&mdash;on them
their denomination marked by a rubber stamp.
(And now you find yourself longing for a rubber
stamp!)</p>

<p>At one shop, I offered coupons cut from Imperial
bonds. Such coupons being good everywhere, I had
faith in them. But, alas, mine were declined. What
did a close reading of the small Russian type reveal?
The canny bond-holder had clipped his coupons and
put them into circulation a little prematurely. And
if I wanted to spend them, I had only to wait a small
matter of six Siberian winters. The coupons were
not due for payment till 1925! (If a Czar ever
comes back to the throne of Russia, he is that many
coupons ahead!)</p>

<p>The postage-stamp money is the greatest nuisance
of all. It is ungummed, and may be termed cubist
cash, for it is wrapped into cubes bound round by a
paper band. These cubes are popularly supposed
to contain two rubles&#8217; worth of ten-kopeck stamps,
and &#8220;2R&#8221; is written on each band. The trusting
stranger does not question the value of the packets.
Few people ever remove the bands to verify. This
is left to the tireless and over-suspicious Chinese.
And it is invariably your bland-faced laundryman
who shows you that your packets are short. From
another aspect, the broken cubes have their drawback.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
They are little and elusive, these stamps.
Your cold fingers are all thumbs. So it is fatal to
attempt to do business with stamps in a brisk wind.</p>

<p>The unlimited variation in money complicates
every petty detail of life in Siberia. Because each
purchase resolves itself into an argument over the
merit of the paper you offer&mdash;or take. And I found
it less wearing to wash my own handkerchiefs than
to engage in a wordy battle with a Russian-speaking
Chino. The illogical variation in the sizes of paper
money presents complications within complications.
For size, in the case of Imperials, has nothing to
do with value. A thousand-ruble note is as ample
as your commission from the President. Which
leads you into the assumption that a small note is
of small value. Not so. In this land of topsy-turvy,
a twenty-or forty-ruble note is one-sixth the size of
a five-ruble note. (And by virtue of somebody&#8217;s
whim, a ten-ruble note is only slightly smaller than
a five!) And if an Allied officer gets thoroughly
acquainted with a five-ruble note, can you blame him
if he tips his drosky-driver with a tiny twenty-ruble
note which he mistakes for twenty kopecks?</p>

<p>Even in a land where unbacked money is good,
there is actually some money that is bad! Siberia
is papered with Imperial counterfeits. This increases
the strain on the newcomer. One must become
an expert in identifying money, or go broke.
Some notes are good if there is a dot in one corner
of the engraved border: if the dot is missing, so is
the value. The counterfeit Imperial twenty-ruble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
notes have the zero standing straight up: the genuine
have the zero a little askew&mdash;the counterfeiter having
improved on the Imperial engraving!</p>

<p>You soon learn all sorts of devices by which you
return to circulation your bad money. You contrive
to pay off drosky-drivers hastily, and in dark
streets. For the first time in your life you delight
in tipping the hat-bandits at the doors of restaurants.
By the time these rascals have discovered
your iniquity, you have disappeared into the frozen
night. Gamblers palm off their faulty currency in
the excitement of the game, there being no time to
submit the pot to cross examination. But beware,
oh stranger, the too-obliging person who would turn
your American money into rubles!</p>

<p>In addition to counterfeiting, there is another
worry. The banks of some inland cities devised a
method of depreciating vast quantities of Bolshevist
money not held by themselves. In this way: They
stamped their own; and generously offered to stamp,
before a certain date, any currency that was submitted
to them for marking. But the date set followed
close upon the announcement, which excluded
from the benefits of the plan, all persons who did
not learn of the offer and so failed to have their
money stamped on time. The banks, since they refused
to recognize unstamped notes, now had&mdash;by
this system of crossing their fingers&mdash;the bulk of
the &#8220;good&#8221; money!</p>

<p>The poorest kinds of money are continually forced
to the surface. The better kinds&mdash;Imperials and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
Kerenskys&mdash;emerge reluctantly. At Chita, my hotel
charged exorbitant rates, based on Bolshevist
scrip. I had only Imperials. A Cossack officer who
was a friend had only Bolshevist notes. So when I
paid my weekly bill, I swapped my Imperials with
the Cossack&mdash;and paid the greedy proprietor in the
poorer paper.</p>

<p>With money good to-day and not so good to-morrow,
or vice versa, what a field for speculation presents
itself! And fortunes are being made on the
rise and fall of Imperials. With rubles ten for a
dollar in Vladivostok, and seven for a dollar in
Khabarovsk (for rubles are dearer sometimes in
inland cities), you have only to buy a gripful at the
one place, hop a train and rake in a fortune at the
other. Return and repeat. And as the rate changes
from day to day, there is always a lively interest
in the fluctuation. It is said that when a Russian
baby is born in Vladivostok, he immediately asks the
doctor, &#8220;How much are rubles to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why should anyone wonder that Siberia is largely
Bolshevist? Our Committee on Public Information
tried to fight Bolshevism with movies, by word
of mouth, through millions of pamphlets printed in
Russian in the United States, and with a telegraphic
news service. The Bolshevists handed out real cash.
The people still believe that they have found Rainbow&#8217;s
End. They are drugged with money&mdash;they
are drunk on it!</p>

<p>What solidarity has a country once its financial
system has gone to pot? If we want to buy Siberian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
raw materials, what money can we offer them? And
if they buy from us&mdash;? If we recognize the Bolshevist
government, shall we recognize its money? Will
we take that money at face value? If not at face
value then at what price?</p>

<p><i>If</i> the Bolshevist money be declared no good, there
will be another revolt. On the other hand, if those
billions are redeemed, the country that redeems them
will be beggared. Why? Because no one knows
the amount outstanding&mdash;and who could stop those
busy printing-presses?</p>

<small>LEAVES FROM MY NOTE BOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Siberia</span> is one of the richest lands in the world
in undeveloped resources. The wealth in its plains
and hills, its rivers and forests, is beyond computation.
Our wheat fields of the northwest in comparison
to the wheat plains of Siberia are but backyard
gardens.</p>

<p>Thousands of square miles in Siberia are literally
underlaid with precious metals, its great forests
are filled with fur-bearing animals, its rivers teem
with great fish, its bird-life offers unlimited food possibilities.</p>

<p>Siberian butter in normal times is shipped to
Europe by train-loads and much of it sold through
Denmark as Danish butter. Siberian honey is famous
for its flavor. Fur and hair, hides and meat,
vegetables and forage&mdash;Siberia could feed the world
if its agricultural industries were operated under
modern methods.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We think of Siberia as a land buried in snow
most of the year. There is snow in the foothills of
the Urals and beyond, and far to the north, but
early in February, traveling from Chita to Vladivostok,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
a distance of some two thousand miles, I
saw brown plains from horizon to horizon day after
day without a patch of snow the size of my hand.
There is very cold weather, it is true, but with proper
clothing, homes properly heated, trains and shops
properly equipped for keeping out the cold, the low
temperatures do not cause much discomfort. However,
it is not comfortable to remain out of doors
very long during the bitter cold. The seventy-two-below
weather registered in Chita, and mentioned
elsewhere in this book was not so terrible as it
sounds, when there was absence of wind. The air
in Chita was very rare, as that city has an elevation
of nearly five thousand feet above sea level, and is
just below the High Plain of Vitim. The climate is
invigorating.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transportation is the great problem of Siberia.
I have heard it said by Colonel Emerson, general
manager of the Great Northern Railway, that the
Trans-Siberian Railway loses money on freight
charges of five cents per ton mile. Our American
railways operated before the war at good profits
with freight charges computed in mills per ton mile.</p>

<p>Graft and ignorance, waste and laziness, even before
the Bolshevist troubles, sapped the life from
the organization. The line was strewn with scrap
metal, from trucks with flat wheels to all the small
parts which break on trains. The Japanese bought
this scrap as junk, remilled it at home and sold it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
back to the Russians at from five to ten times its
cost as scrap.</p>

<p>The repair shops ran at a very low point of efficiency,
and without modern machinery&mdash;bolts, for
instance, being made by hand! The whole system
appeared to be run for no other purpose than creating
jobs, and was over-manned.</p>

<p>Business is done in Siberia at a high margin of
profit in order to offset losses by theft. It is estimated
that twenty-five per cent must be allowed to cover
loss by theft. Goods left in the customs house over
night under the care of watchmen are not always
found intact in the morning&mdash;the cases are opened
and goods abstracted. A car-load of shoes shipped
to an inland city arrived apparently safe, with the
seals on the cars unbroken. When opened, the car
was found to be full of cord-wood. A person unfamiliar
with the country had better avoid doing
business on a small scale there. An American who
came to Chita with fifty suits of ready-to-wear clothing,
had to part with about half of his lot to pay
graft.</p>

<p>The velvet covering on the seats of cars is all
ripped off. I heard that the Bolshevists took the
coverings to make clothing. At a theater I saw
many women in gowns of blue, gray and red velvet,
and discovered that the blues had come from first-class
cars, the gray from second-class cars, and the
red from third-class cars. Combined with old lace
curtains, the stuff made rather attractive gowns.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>A British colonel, coming up from Vladivostok
with regular troops bound for the front, wired to
Chita to the &#8220;British consul&#8221; to arrange for four
hundred baths, twenty buckets, two hundred loaves
of bread and communion service of the Church of
England for four hundred men. He also stated
that he wanted a hall in which the men could eat
their Christmas dinner, the hall to be decorated
with holly and other greenwood stuff.</p>

<p>The British officer who opened the telegram did
his best, but there was a hitch about the communion
service, because the Russian church could not give
communion to non-communicants. When the colonel
arrived, he cited the fact that a Russian bishop had
once arranged with a bishop of the Church of England
for mutual exchanges of courtesy in regard to
communion in emergencies. His men marched to
a Russian church for services that day, but did not
receive communion. They were taken out of their
crowded box-cars, bathed and fed and preached to,
and paraded through the streets of Chita with fifes
and drums.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Early one morning I was summoned to the military
prison of a certain town. A note was brought
to me by a smart young Cossack, who clicked his
heels, saluted most deferentially, and remained at
attention in the best military manner while in my
room. He said the note was from the prison commandant,
and when my orderly had read it, he said
my presence at the prison was requested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>We drove to the prison, and informed the sentry
at the gate that we wished to see the commandant.
Thereupon we were ushered into a spacious corridor,
crowded with prisoners.</p>

<p>A young man pushed his way out of the crowd
and accosted me in Russian. I told him that I could
not talk with him till I had seen the commandant.
He then said in perfect English: &#8220;I am an American&mdash;I
am going to be shot. You must save me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was my business to protect Americans.</p>

<p>&#8220;What part of the United States are you from?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York City&mdash;Grand Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you born in New York City?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I was born in Russia. But I am an American.
You tell &#8217;em they can&#8217;t shoot me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When were you naturalized in America?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t take out any papers. But I lived
in New York nine years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Russia is your country. When did you
come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About a year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to help my country.&#8221; Now the tears
were running down his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My orderly here was also born in Russia,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;But he is a naturalized American citizen, and has
been six years in the regular army. You have come
back to help your country, but your country does not
appear to appreciate your services. You might have
returned in an American uniform, but for nine years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
you lived in New York and did not care to become
an American citizen. Now you claim American
protection. Why are you going to be shot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I never was told. Please go and
ask to see my papers. Every minute is valuable!
Save my life! I am a good American!&#8221;</p>

<p>The other prisoners now swarmed about us. The
commandant pushed through them and eyed me angrily.
I told my orderly to inform him that I had
come in response to his summons, and handed over
his note.</p>

<p>To my amazement he stared at the note and declared
that he had neither written it nor sent it.
And he informed me that the very smart young
Cossack soldier, who had clicked his heels so ceremoniously,
was a suspected Bolshevist against whom
no definite evidence had been found. And this
&#8220;soldier&#8221; had himself been released from the prison
only that morning! (Later in the day he was re-arrested
for bringing the forged message to me.)</p>

<p>I explained to the commandant that under the
circumstances I had no intention of interfering, but I
desired that the execution might be delayed till I
could talk with the local chief of staff. He assented.</p>

<p>I drove hurriedly to the office of the chief of staff
of the Cossack commander, and asked about the
prisoner. The passport of the condemned man was
put before me. He had obtained the passport as
a Russian subject. Also, he had pretended upon
arrival to be an envoy sent by radicals in the United
States to the Bolshevists. And I was shown clippings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
from Russian papers, which related how the
&#8220;New Yorker&#8221; had in street speeches after his arrival
in Siberia denounced the government of the
United States as &#8220;capitalistic.&#8221; He had been arrested
while trying to pass through a certain city
with Bolshevist dispatches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish the execution might be delayed,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;until I can talk with this man again. He might
give me some information of value.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief of staff nodded his head, and as I went
out, reached for the telephone.</p>

<p>I drove back to the prison. The commandant,
now smiling and suave, led me, when I asked to see
the prisoner, to a window overlooking the prison
yard. There he pointed to a figure lying in the reddened
snow. It was the &#8220;New Yorker.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a party of condemned prisoners taken out for
execution, there was a woman from the East Side
of New York. She brought up the rear of the little
column. She was a tall, fine-looking Jewess, and
bore herself proudly, looking with scorn at the firing-squad.</p>

<p>When the death-grove was reached there was
some delay. She observed Americans among the
on-lookers, and beckoned them over to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, they&#8217;re not going to shoot me,&#8221; she boasted.
&#8220;Look at me&mdash;I am an attractive woman. I
have been in that prison two months.&#8221; And significantly,
&#8220;I have been a good friend to the commandant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
Tell him I want to speak to him.&#8221; She smiled
coyly.</p>

<p>The commandant came. He smiled at her admiringly,
and gave her an intimate wink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am not going to have you shot,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;I had to bring you out here to make the
others think that I am not showing you any favoritism.
But my soldiers have orders not to aim
at you. Do not fear the volley.&#8221;</p>

<p>These was a sharp command. The rifles came up.
Some of the condemned dropped to their knees in
the snow to pray, some made a brave show of facing
the muzzles without a tremor, others openly wept.
But the woman stood upright, with a confident smile
on her lips, sure that none of the bullets was for
her.</p>

<p>The volley crashed upon the cold air. The woman&#8217;s
face took on an awful look of surprise. Her
body snapped backward from the impact of flying
lead, and then she pitched forward upon her face
in the snow.</p>

<p>There are no sex lines drawn in matters of this
kind. No, indeed, there is perfect equality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mass of the people in Siberia are Bolshevist.
I would say that ninety-eight per cent of them are
Bolshevist. This assertion can be very easily misunderstood,
and anti-Bolshevists will undoubtedly
attack it, while the Bolshevist propagandists will
probably use it to prove that they have as adherents
the mass of the people. But by &#8220;Bolshevist&#8221; I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
not mean that the people have studied Bolshevism
and have decided to adhere to it because they feel
that Bolshevism is the form of government which
they want&mdash;far from it.</p>

<p>What I do mean to say is that the mass of the
people, being discontented and being in poverty,
favor Bolshevism because it is the only thing which
promises them the license which they believe to be
liberty. It is a system which has demonstrated to
them that they have a right to take what they can;
it is a system that tells them that they can do no
wrong because they have been wronged&mdash;that no
matter what the poor man does, he is right. It
is the &#8220;divine right of kings&#8221; applied to the proletariat&mdash;it
makes every man a king provided he has
been a man who worked for somebody else.</p>

<p>When I assert that the mass of the people are Bolshevist
in their tendencies, I do not mean that they
are all able to discuss Bolshevism intelligently, nor
do I mean that they are fighting in the ranks of the
Bolshevist army with arms. I mean that the drosky-driver,
the waiter, the railroad man,&mdash;all working
classes,&mdash;are hostile to any man who attempts to
tell them that Bolshevism is wrong, or any man who
looks as though he did not work with his hands. By
&#8220;Bolshevism&#8221; I mean class hatred. The mass of the
people of Siberia have been exploited so long, and
have been tricked by promises which were never kept,
that they are willing to be exploited by any person
who comes along and tells them that they own everything
in the country merely because they work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>They have never known good government. They
do not believe that it exists. To them &#8220;government&#8221;
means oppression, whether it is government in the
United States, or government by the Czar.</p>

<p>Now if the mass of the people are Bolshevist
(admitting my assertion for the sake of argument,
if it cannot be accepted fully) and the forces of the
United States in Siberia attempt to control the people,
it might be argued that we would be opposing
the wishes of the majority of the people of Siberia&mdash;not
allowing them to have the form of government
they desire. In other words, if we go to war
against Bolshevism, it means killing all Bolshevists,
and if nearly all the people in Siberia are Bolshevistic,
it would mean, carried to its logical conclusion,
killing or bringing into subjection the mass of
people in Siberia.</p>

<p>We do not wish to do that. Then why do we
not let them remain Bolshevist and run the country
with soviets?</p>

<p>We are a-straddle a barbed-wire fence in Siberia.
The Czechs and the Cossacks have whipped the Bolshevist
forces in Siberia. We have aided neither the
Czechs nor the Cossacks militarily, and the Bolshevists
have been waiting till we and the Czechs got
out. While waiting, the Bolshevists have joined Cossack
armies or have behaved themselves to some
extent&mdash;they are waiting till the Allies in Siberia
give them a clear field again. And the Allies have
been surrounded by a vanishing army&mdash;fighting Bolshevists
who quit fighting and &#8220;surrender&#8221; when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
they see that they are in danger of capture or defeat.</p>

<p>I do not believe that Bolshevism is going to be
destroyed by &#8220;decisive defeats&#8221; of Bolshevist
armies. Bolshevist forces have been &#8220;decisively defeated&#8221;
time and again, and driven out of many
cities, only to reorganize in the rear of their attackers.
Bolshevism can only be smothered by
attacking the idea of Bolshevism, for it is a soul-disease
which has infected vast masses of people
who have been wronged for centuries.</p>

<p>I do not object to the fact that these people wish
to correct the wrongs of government, the wrongs of
exploitation, the wrongs of enforced poverty which
they have endured in a land of great natural wealth.
The greatest wrong which has been committed
against them is the system which has kept them in
ignorance. They must be saved from their own
ignorance. They must be saved from a new exploitation
which is greater than any they have ever known.
I do not believe that wrongs against a people can
be righted by committing new wrongs.</p>

<p>These people who are Bolshevist in their tendencies,
are Bolshevist because they have not seen anything
better than Bolshevism, which was visualized
for them in tons of worthless money distributed to
them. We must demonstrate good government to
them, even though we have to &#8220;interfere&#8221; to do so.
They are ready to swing to anything which proves
its worth. We have attempted to prove things by
reasoning, when they are not equipped mentally to
reason. They suspect and fear us because we reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
while we have an expedition on their ground&mdash;and
soldiers to them mean intimidation, treachery and
death. They do not trust each other, how can they
trust us? They do not trust the Japanese, and we
are allied with the Japanese.</p>

<small>THE JOKER IN BOLSHEVISM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Bolshevists of Siberia hate wall-paper. After
traveling in that country, I came to the conclusion
that a Bolshevist operates on the theory that there
can be no freedom for anybody so long as a single
strip of wall-paper remains on any wall. Neither
can there be any freedom while glassware is unbroken,
furniture unsmashed, curtains are whole,
windows intact, books unburned. And the parlor
Bolshevists of the United States, if they were really
consistent, would stop talking and start a little freedom
in their own homes by pulling everything down
that is up, and pulling everything up that is down,
sweeping the total into the street and putting a
match to it.</p>

<p>There is a joker in this &#8220;new form of government&#8221;
known as Bolshevism. In fact, the joker is
the very core of the whole matter. Mutilated wall-paper
gave me my first inkling of that joker. In
Chita, the searchers after freedom had done a
thorough job. For not only were the interior walls
of the town everywhere stripped clean, but, according
to the proprietor of a local store the stock in the
different shops had gone to feed the bon-fires.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>&#8220;So the Bolshevists hate wall-paper even before
it is hung,&#8221; I said to this merchant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied through my interpreter. &#8220;I
heard from a friend in another town that soon we&#8217;d
be able to get some from Japan. But a German
prisoner of war, who helps my wife with the cooking,
says to wait till the railroad opens up to Petrograd,
and then I&#8217;ll be able to get cheaper and better
wall-paper from Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>I lunched that day at the Hotel Dayooria. A
German prisoner of war was my waiter. He was a
meek sort of person who had set out from home with
Kultur on the point of his bayonet and now found
himself a slave in a foreign land. He served my
tea in a glass that had been made from a wine bottle
by cutting the top off. The upper edge of the glass
was dangerously sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, captain,&#8221; said the waiter; &#8220;&mdash;no
other glasses now.&#8221; (He spoke in English. He had
learned it in a German school. He gently hinted
that any stray magazines I might have would be
welcome.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when is the boss going to order some
regular goblets?&#8221;&mdash;which was more or less an attempt
at humor on my part, since in Siberia at that
time there was small chance of getting anything from
anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty soon we&#8217;ll have glassware from Germany,&#8221;
the waiter assured me proudly. Then with
a click of his heels, he went back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>That was my second glimpse of the joker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>Across the street from the Dayooria was a much
larger and more modern hotel, the Select. The
lower windows on the street were all boarded up,
for these had been the fronts of banks and shops
when the Bolshevists cut loose on the town, and, in
order to become free, found it necessary to smash
the plate-glass, and loot&mdash;all of which was done to
the (I was going to say King&#8217;s) proletariat&#8217;s taste.</p>

<p>But the interior of the Select had not suffered so
complete a wrecking as the Dayooria. An American
consul had once occupied a room at the Select,
and through the kindness of the Cossack chief of
staff, I was allowed to rent this room, with another
for my interpreter. (The rent was raised each week,
a mere detail even in Bolshevist Siberia.)</p>

<p>There was a shortage of electric globes in Chita.
But the commandant managed so that I had globes
for the three wires hanging from my ceiling, and a
globe for the drop-light on my desk. In the halls of
the hotel, as in my room, the globes hung from the
ceilings on wires. One evening in a hall I observed
a German war prisoner shorten the loop in one wire
so that the globe fell as low as his shoulder. The
next time he came through from the kitchen to the
officers&#8217; mess with a tray, he bumped the globe in
such a manner that it crashed against the wall, and
broke.</p>

<p>The same night I noticed that one of the lights in
my room was not burning. I called the German
prisoner who acted as janitor, and asked him to fix
it. He brought a ladder, climbed up, unscrewed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
globe, dropped it, and broke it. He said he felt
rather bad about it, too. It was a blot on his efficiency.</p>

<p>The next night another globe gave no light. I
investigated myself, by moving my bed and piling my
two lockers on it. The globe burned all right when
it was screwed into the socket. I unscrewed it until
it again failed to burn, moved the bed and lockers
back into place, and called the same German. He
came with his ladder, examined the globe, told me it
was burned out, and took it away.</p>

<p>When the third globe went dark, I found that it
too, had been unscrewed enough to break the circuit.
The German came, climbed his ladder, and with
pliers, when he thought I was not looking, pried off
the glass tip, rendering the globe useless. Then he
told me the globe was no good. And&mdash;there were
no more globes.</p>

<p>Now all I had left was the globe in the drop-light.
Every morning I hid it, and thereby worried
the German. There was evidence that he hunted for
it when I was out of my room. Why were the janitor
and the waiter destroying globes that were a necessity
even to themselves? I clinched my suspicions by
asking a former merchant of electrical supplies this
question: &#8220;Where did you buy your electric globes
and fixtures before the war?&#8221; Well, they came from
Moscow&mdash;mostly made in Germany.</p>

<p>Here was another corner of that joker! When
Russian Bolshevists were afraid they would get
caught breaking things, the German prisoners helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
the game along by doing a little sly smashing on
their own account!</p>

<p>Because I had the room of a former American
consul, the Russian owner of a gold mine near Chita
called upon me, thinking I was the present American
consul. He said he wanted advice as to where he
might, some time in the future, buy mining-machinery.</p>

<p>The Bolshevists had wrecked his entire plant.
Their leaders had told the peasants that the mines
of Siberia belong to all, and that in time a Bolshevist
government would work the mines, and
divide the gold among the people. In that way no
one would become richer than someone else.</p>

<p>&#8220;The German prisoners,&#8221; he said, &#8220;now tell my
workmen that if I have machinery I will need only a
few men, and so hundreds of workmen will be
thrown out of jobs. Of course, if I could put machinery
in I would employ ten times as many men as
I do now. I can&#8217;t make my mine pay without machinery,
and for the present I am employing only
common labor to clean things up so as to be ready
for better times. If we Russian mine owners can&#8217;t
make our mines pay, we&#8217;ll have to sell out. During
the revolution, German capitalists have bought up
a lot of companies in European Russia at bankrupt
prices.</p>

<p>&#8220;But assuming that Germany takes the mines,
how can the Germans hope to operate them if the
workmen refuse to allow machinery to be used in
them?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;You do not know our <i>moujiks</i>,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;They will not believe what I tell them for their
own good. But they will believe the lies of an outsider&mdash;any
childish story told to swindle them. By
the time Germany is ready to sell us machinery, maybe
the <i>moujiks</i> will be told not to smash it&mdash;if the
machinery is German.&#8221;</p>

<p>And picture the amount of mining-machinery that
Siberia will be able to use! For two thousand versts
to the north of Chita there are gold fields. The
fields which have been developed make scarcely a
dot on the map. No. One Russian mine-worker will
not become richer than another when that vast country
is worked. If Germany&#8217;s plans do not miscarry,
those who will profit first will be the German machinery
manufacturers.</p>

<p>It was brought to my attention in a certain part
of Siberia that wool, cow hair and camel hair, valued
at nine million rubles, purchased just before the revolution
by a Boston company through its Moscow
agency, was to be seized. Who was going to seize
it is not a matter for me to discuss here, but I can
say there was good evidence that it would have gone
in the direction of Germany.</p>

<p>The warehouses containing this material were in
three cities, and somehow escaped being burned.
Whenever Bolshevist bands broke loose to loot and
burn, the word must have been passed from some
mysterious fountain-head to spare the warehouses
containing that wool and hair&mdash;for, mind, those
warehouses were in three different cities, far apart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
This would indicate that, after all, there is a system
to Bolshevism. The system appears to be, &#8220;Smash
machinery and manufactured goods but spare raw
material.&#8221; As the wool and hair was owned by an
American company, an inference might be drawn
that the protection was due to its being American
property. If so, why&mdash;when there was a rumor that
American troops might soon be in the vicinity of the
warehouses&mdash;was it to be seized and moved toward
Germany?</p>

<p>Siberian Bolshevists with whom I talked told me
of the great yearning for education among the
masses, and how the Bolshevists would provide
plenty of schools. I examined the condition of
several schools where the Bolshevists had been in
control for a time. Every possible book had been
destroyed&mdash;geographies, grammars, spelling-books.
It was a case of <i>spurlos versenkt</i>. Pens, paper, pencils,
maps, erasers, rulers, ink and all other school
accessories went the way of the books&mdash;to the bon-fires
in the streets. A yearning to learn? Certainly.
One might describe it as a burning desire. And will
it not be fine for Leipsic to print Russia&#8217;s new school
books, with some German propaganda thrown in
free? Also, <i>lieber Gott</i>, vot a market for pencils and
other little things! (Note for Leipsic: Printers in
Japan are already printing Russian books!)</p>

<p>There is a significant angle to the smashing and
burning that has gone on in Russia&mdash;an angle which
the American working man should bear in mind
when he is told that Russian Bolshevists are on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
right track for turning a <i>moujik</i> into a magnate over
night. Russia is a great producer of raw material.
Smashed machinery there means that whatever raw
material escapes destruction must seek a foreign
market. Naturally, if such material cannot be sold
to a Russian factory, the factory abroad buys it much
cheaper than if there were a home demand for it.
Also, smashed machinery in Russia means no production
in Russia of manufactured goods; and no
manufactured goods in Russia means that the very
working men who smashed the machinery must buy
goods manufactured abroad.</p>

<p>Further, if there are no goods manufactured in
Russia, the foreign manufacturer makes his own
prices, both for what he buys from Russia and what
he sells to her. In other words, he gets raw materials
from her at low prices, and sells manufactured
goods to her at high prices. This forces all Russian
labor, skilled as well as unskilled, into working at
low wages on the production of raw materials, and
the cost of the raw materials is constantly being
pulled down because, with no Russian demand for
factory-skilled labor, there is a surplus of labor. So
the Russian manufacturing capitalist is wiped out,
sure enough, along with all machinery. Also, in
time, Russian skilled labor will be wiped out!</p>

<p>And for this condition of affairs, Russians can
thank themselves!</p>

<p>Germany realized how crude were her methods
when she sent to Belgium and France a force that,
operating behind her fighting men, wrecked or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
burned factories, and seized raw material. That was
a job she did herself, and she had to take the blame
of the whole world for it. She had to devise a
scheme by which she could get the same results elsewhere
without having to bear any blame.</p>

<p>That scheme was Bolshevism. The craftiest criminals
always use fools as their tools. And in Bolshevism
Germany found the <i>Ersatz</i>, or substitute,
for an army of thieving and destroying Germans.
It has been estimated that more than a million Germans
are prisoners of war in Russia. These men
whispered anti-capitalistic propaganda into the ear
of the poor <i>moujik</i>, who wants education so badly
that he is willing to burn school books, and who
thinks he can attain freedom by ripping off wall-paper.
And the <i>moujik</i>, under skillful leadership,
did Germany&#8217;s work, and did it for nothing. That
same Ivan who had died by millions to beat the Germans
ran home from the trenches and wrecked his
own country to the Kaiser&#8217;s taste, at the Kaiser&#8217;s
word&mdash;wrecked it more thoroughly than the German
armies would have been able to wreck it. For
he smashed everything but the ikons and the rubber-plants.
Why he did not destroy the rubber-plants we
cannot understand. Is it because Germany does not
wish to sell rubber-plants to Russia?</p>

<p>So keen were the Germans to help the Russian
Bolshevists to &#8220;overthrow the Russian capitalists,&#8221;
that the German capitalists loaned the Bolshevists
armored cars and cannon made in Germany by the
Krupp works and in Austria by the Skoda works.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
Evidently the German capitalists had suddenly fallen
in love with the Russian proletariat! (This is a nut
for our own parlor Bolshevists to crack.)</p>

<p>I can guess how they will crack it. They will say,
&#8220;Yes, the Russian Bolshevists took help from the
German capitalists, but in time they will turn those
guns upon the very capitalists who loaned them.&#8221;
Yet what I ask to know, as Hashimura Togo would
say, is, &#8220;Why did the German capitalists ever begin
to help the Bolshevists?&#8221;</p>

<p>After all, Russian capitalists are the only people
who can give Russian working men jobs. By the
same token, German capitalists are the only people
who can give German working men jobs. If the German
capitalists do not want the Russian capitalists to
be able to give jobs to Russians, are the German
capitalists who loaned guns to Russian Bolshevists,
friends of the Russian working men?</p>

<p>The first parlor Bolshevist who answers that
question correctly will explain the joker in Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Germany mobilized the fools of Russia. Why
not, she asked herself, extend a scheme that worked
so successfully with the <i>moujiks</i> to the working populations
of other countries? She began to have hopes
(with the aid of Bolshevist propaganda) of mobilizing
the malcontents everywhere. Capital, if not
wiped out, could at least be frightened or forced into
a period of non-production&mdash;or production at high
prices. High prices, in turn, create demands for
higher wages&mdash;demands that usually take the form<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
of strikes. Labor troubles may lead to riots, or even
revolution&mdash;with consequent destruction. And to
judge by Belgium, northern France and Russia,
destruction is what Germany wants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, rumors of riots in the Fatherland
encourage Bolshevism in other countries. We have
had copious news of Bolshevist troubles in Germany.
The fact that we get this news over German wires
is evidence that Germany wants us to get it. It makes
a fine smoke-screen behind which stand her great
untouched factories with their unsmashed machinery.</p>

<p>The Germans told the Russians that the great
war was a &#8220;capitalistic war.&#8221; Germany was right.
But she neglected to say that it was designed to aid
the German capitalists. And if enough fools in every
other country can be induced to smash and tear and
burn, saving only (take note) some raw materials,
then with her own factories and machinery intact,
Germany can flood the world with her own cheap
manufactured goods.</p>

<p>For this is the joker in Bolshevism: The providing
for Germany, of colossal markets!</p>

<p>And if she has these markets created for her, the
indemnity which the Allies have demanded, and
which Germany says is &#8220;staggering,&#8221; will be to her
a mere handful of small change.</p>

<small>THE UNITED STATES IN ASIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must be fairly obvious to the reader in following
my account of what I saw and heard in Siberia
that I regard the whole adventure on the part of the
United States in Siberia as a failure, whether it is
regarded in the light of being an attempt at international
diplomacy, military intervention, a gesture
of friendship toward Russia, or an enterprise in the
nature of insurance against the spread of Bolshevism.</p>

<p>Primarily, it began as a new campaign against
Germany-to prevent Germany from getting possession
of war-stores in Russia and Siberia and replenishing
her stocks of food, munitions and men and
to prevent her from penetrating the country for conquest.
There was every reason for our being in Russia,
both on the Archangel front, and in Siberia, to
accomplish these ends. Our presence in Siberia alone
was a menace to Germany, a threat of a thrust
through her back door in combination with the other
powers involved with us, including Russians, Czecho-Slovaks,
British, French, Japanese and others interested
and concerned.</p>

<p>But we went about it even before the armistice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
was dreamed of, in a tentative manner. We did not
start a campaign, we began a debating society. We
twiddled our thumbs all winter in Siberia, while the
forces of evil, Bolshevist and others, took advantage
of our lack of decision on anything and acquired a
certain technique in a chicane suitable to the conditions
existing to thwart us in any decision we might
reach in the future.</p>

<p>We kept insisting that we were helping Russia by
being in Siberia. The Czechs, the Russians and the
Japanese knew that only action could help, and action
meant fighting those who were ruining the country.
We were helping Russia and Siberia in just
about the manner a man might help a family which
was being beaten and robbed by burglars if the man
sat out on the front porch and remarked: &#8220;If this
thing gets too serious, I am here with a gun to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>And while he sat there, the members of the family
still alive, yelled frantically: &#8220;This is serious now&mdash;half
my children are dead, and the biggest robber
has me by the throat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whereupon the visitor on the porch would reply:
&#8220;If I do anything rough I will hurt somebody&#8217;s feelings.
I don&#8217;t want to do that. But if you kill the
robbers, then you have settled the affair yourself,
with my moral support. But I am not quite sure the
robbers are not in the right. I am your friend, if
you win this fight; if the robber wins it, I want to
make friends with him. In the meantime, I can supply
you with a Red Cross nurse to bind your wounds
if you escape alive; I can give you food if the robber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
steals or destroys all you have to eat; I can send you
ministers to bury you with prayers if you are killed,
or to preach to you if you are spared. I am a Good
Samaritan but I must not interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>While we were thus pausing and surveying the
wreckage, human and material, various Cossack
chiefs, schooled in the methods of the old r&eacute;gime,
seized power and began building up principalities
of their own&mdash;Kalmikoff as governor-general of the
Ussuri district, and Semenoff as boss of the Trans-Baikal.</p>

<p>They used the old tricks of autocracy&mdash;swords
and ceremony&mdash;which the people feared and by
which they were impressed with demonstrations of
physical power. Then to catch the imagination of
the nations which wished to see Russia rehabilitate
herself speedily, they began to talk in a patter, the
key-note of which was, and is: &#8220;I stand for a free
and reunited Russia, a Russia greater than the old.&#8221;
Whereupon they proceeded to deny anything in the
nature of freedom, and to disunite Russia. All they
stood for, and still stand for, is their own glorification
and reward and the gambler&#8217;s chance that
they will inherit the throne of the Czars. If they
cannot attain to such ambitions, at least they hope
to sell out their usurped powers in case some figure
of imperial lineage comes out of hiding to take the
shattered crown.</p>

<p>We kept assuring the Siberians that our government
stood as their friend, at the same time neither
denouncing, nor interfering with these usurpers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
people, for all their abysmal ignorance, knew perfectly
well what was going on&mdash;they recognized
autocracy because they had to submit to it. And,
speaking generally, the attitude of the United States
was: &#8220;Why cannot you people get together and settle
up this mess&mdash;all you have to do is come to an
agreement, and reunite Russia!&#8221;</p>

<p>This while several civil wars were being fought in
the country!</p>

<p>At home our press and public were making a hue
and cry against Bolshevism. Yet in Siberia were
Cossack chiefs with little armies opposed to the Bolshevists,
but inactive because they were not sure what
we might do. Our failure to throw in with these
chiefs, led the Bolshevist leaders to hope, if not
actually believe, that we favored Bolshevism, or at
least did not dare fight it. At any rate, our &#8220;do
nothing&#8221; policy allowed the Bolshevist leaders,
crafty in intrigue, propaganda and organization, to
whisper to their wavering adherents that the United
States was passively favoring them and that recognition
of the Bolshevist government was only a matter
of time.</p>

<p>In effect, our operations for nearly a year, were
a subsidy to Bolshevism. Our civilian-aid agencies
were unwitting helpers to the secret Bolshevists of
Siberia, for they gave comfort and encouragement to
the idea that Bolshevism in Siberia was a success.
We repaired a lot of damage that Bolshevism had
done, before the people of Siberia could realize what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
the destruction meant&mdash;before they could learn for
themselves what a mess they had made of things.</p>

<p>Our government did relief work, and became
actually thereby an ally of the Bolshevist r&eacute;gime,
though maintaining an attitude of non-interference&mdash;neutrality.</p>

<p>&#8220;One faction is as bad as another,&#8221; was the way
our spokesmen put it. That was a comforting
phrase, but not true. It meant blaming our own
ignorance on the factions. It was on the same scale
as the statement made so often after the outbreak of
the war: &#8220;Europe has gone war-mad&mdash;one nation
is as bad as the other,&#8221; a frame of mind which
helped Germany. How the Bolshevist leaders must
have chuckled when they heard that the United
States classed them as no better and no worse than
the Russians who were actively fighting Bolshevism,
and opposing it in other ways. And the gallant
Czechs were amazed and discouraged by our failure
to co&ouml;perate with them to the extent they had been
led to believe that we would.</p>

<p>Kalmikoff and Semenoff, more particularly the
former, carried on executions by the wholesale. It
was a system of eliminating such persons as might
oppose them. Some of the victims were probably
Bolshevists, but many of them were decent and
orderly Russians from our viewpoint. They dared
whisper their suspicions against the Cossack chiefs&mdash;that
was enough to send them to the execution
party.</p>

<p>For instance, men and women of Khabarovsk protested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
to Colonel Styer that Kalmikoff had their
friends and relatives in prison and would shoot
them. Colonel Styer took the matter up with Kalmikoff.
That night fifteen or twenty men were
chosen at random from the prison, taken out into
a grove, and shot down. They did not know what
they had been arrested for, they had never been tried.</p>

<p>This sort of thing went on for months after our
forces were stationed in Khabarovsk. But with
Washington giving strict orders that there should be
nothing in the nature of &#8220;interference,&#8221; what could
Colonel Styer do? Yet at the same time we were
assuring the &#8220;loyal&#8221; Russians that our troops were
on the ground for their protection.</p>

<p>To the Russians, who could not possibly fathom
our policy and could not know what was going on between
our commanders and Kalmikoff, it looked as
if our troops were there to protect Kalmikoff while
he decimated the population. And Kalmikoff continued
to lift himself into power by the simple process
of killing off everybody who objected to his
assuming autocratic powers.</p>

<p>Yet Kalmikoff and Semenoff, if properly dealt
with from the first, might have joined forces with
us against the Bolshevists. They could not have
opposed us. They both have certain qualities as military
leaders, and while they undoubtedly are monarchists
or &#8220;men on horseback,&#8221; they are certainly
anti-Bolshevist. And if we had adopted an anti-Bolshevist
policy from the start, this policy would have
given us a point of contact with the Cossack chiefs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
We could have demanded that they behave themselves,
get busy and fight Bolshevists at the front.</p>

<p>But they camped down in Khabarovsk and Chita,
clamped a tight lid on the press in their districts,
and inspired the writing of articles for the local
newspapers which extolled their own virtues as Russian
patriots, and denounced the other Cossack
chiefs with whom they were at odds. And the peculiar
fact about this press campaign, was that when
each told of the others faults and selfish ambitions,
he was telling the truth, as truth goes in Siberia.</p>

<p>The press muzzled or subsidized, the whole country
became befogged in a mass of rumors, gossip,
lies and slander. The Americans heard all kinds of
stories against the Japanese, as no doubt the Japanese
heard the most fanciful tales about us; the
Czechs became disgruntled and sullen because they
felt we were not helping them as we should; if an
American officer became friendly with a Russian and
sought his views on the situation, another Russian
sought the American out to warn him against his
informant. Each Russian professed to be a &#8220;loyal&#8221;
Russian. I found that all Russians are loyal Russians.
The difficulty was to ascertain just what
&#8220;loyal&#8221; meant. The test for us, should have been,
loyal to what idea of government?</p>

<p>I am familiar with the assertion that our expedition
was opposing the Bolshevists with armed force.
When did we threaten any Bolshevists till the Bolshevists
attacked us? Is inviting all factions to &#8220;get
together&#8221; at Prinkipo, opposing Bolshevists? Is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
opposing monarchists? Is it opposing <i>hetmen</i> who
emulate Villa? Is it backing a democratic form of
government in Russia?</p>

<p>One thing is certain&mdash;neither a monarchy nor a
republic can be formed in all Russia so long as Bolshevism
remains in the saddle. And our unwillingness
to oppose Bolshevism was in effect giving it aid
and strength. Many who were wavering in their
sympathy for Bolshevism, turned to it again secretly
when they saw what the Cossack chiefs were doing
with apparent sanction of the United States.</p>

<p>Our attitude of neutrality in Russian affairs gave
the Bolshevist agents their chance to decry our
promises of aid. They said: &#8220;Look! The United
States knows Bolshevism is too strong to quarrel
with openly. Who is the United States standing in
with? Your enemies, the Cossack chiefs, who are
fighting us in order to restore to power the old
r&eacute;gime. The United States stands back and allows
the Cossacks to execute you. The American commanders
protest mildly, but do the executions stop?
No. The United States hopes the Cossacks will defeat
us, but the United States does not dare fight,
because they want to be able to make friends with
us when we control the whole country. They know
they will have to recognize us in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>No doubt Bolshevism will die out in time. All
zealots are born despots, and Russia will not submit
to the despotism of Bolshevism any more than it
will submit from now on for a long period, to any
form of cruel despotism. Can we claim, when Bolshevism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
burns out, to have aided in breaking its
back?</p>

<p>Neutrality, between right and wrong, is a crime.
It was invented by militaristic criminals who want to
murder nations, and make sure that there will be no
interference by neighbors.</p>

<p>The thug, murdering his victim, resents the interference
of the passerby, by saying: &#8220;This is none
of your business.&#8221; He demands neutrality.</p>

<p>So it has become a virtuous act for a nation, when
two nations engage in war, to declare itself neutral.
We realize now that something is wrong in this
system, so we have devised the league of nations
idea. This idea is nothing more than an agreement
that there shall be no more neutrality. If a nation
threatens war, all the others agree to take sides. The
fact that all the others may combine against the
aggressor, or the nation adjudged to be in the wrong,
automatically prevents the war. Unless the aggressing
nation feels strong enough to defy the others, or
able to accomplish its purpose of destruction before
the others can get into action.</p>

<p>But issues between nations are often beclouded,
or the minds of peoples are befogged, or populations
become divided over what is right and what is
wrong. A league of nations, to operate according
to the ideals of the idea, presupposes the ability of
peoples, or their leaders, to make swift decision as to
who is right and who is wrong. It calls for not
merely national statesmanship, but international
statesmanship&mdash;which is always for right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>We wanted to operate on the patient in Siberia
but the doctors could not decide whether to take out
the appendix of Bolshevism, or cut off the head that
ached without a crown. The patient is still suffering
from a bad appendix&mdash;and a violent headache.</p>

<p>We said at home that Bolshevism menaced the
world. It had ruined Siberia. We were in Siberia
with troops. We should have attacked Bolshevism
on its native heath, and declared to Russia and the
world that once the Bolshevists were whipped and
knew they were whipped, we would stand beside the
nation till it had reorganized itself in its own non-Bolshevist
way.</p>

<p>Japan expected us to do those things, just as
England did. We practically forbade Japan from
going into Siberia without our sanction, or without
us. We decried intervention or interference, and
then proceeded to intervene. I do not care what
other term is used in describing our landing an
expedition in Siberia&mdash;it was intervention. It was a
measure for the safety of Russia, and for our own
protection.</p>

<p>The minute our first armed man stepped upon the
dock at Vladivostok, we had intervened&mdash;we had
interfered. It was our business to be effective, to
justify our presence there, to act in the manner we
thought proper and be responsible for our acts. All
the others would have been glad to co&ouml;perate with
us, I am sure.</p>

<p>In fact, all parties looked to us for leadership,
regardless of what their private ideas or ambitions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
may have been. Japan was ready to co&ouml;perate with
us, but we disgusted Japan by our failure to do anything
but sit on the lid of the Pandora&#8217;s box in Vladivostok.
Japan went ahead and did a few things on
her own account, and then there were whispers in
certain quarters that Japan wanted to grab Siberia.</p>

<p>If Japan did want to grab Siberia, it was because
the lackadaisical attitude of the United States made
Japan feel that whatever Japan did, the United
States would not do much more than mildly protest.</p>

<p>I do not doubt that Japan would like to have Siberia,
or at least the littoral of the Maritime Provinces
with ownership or control of Vladivostok. She
would like to hook that country up with Korea, and
have a barrier between her own Empire and whatever
Russia will develop or degenerate into in the
future. And considering Japan&#8217;s position in Asia,
her necessity for expansion, and more particularly
her system of government, this ambition to control
the Siberian littoral is consistent with her whole
scheme of self-protection. The morality of the
policy is not for discussion here.</p>

<p>England would have been willing to follow our
lead, and co&ouml;perate with us. But tired of our dallying,
England sent her forces up to the front, and
took a chance of having the Trans-Siberian railroad
break down between her advanced troops and their
base. And England stands higher in the regard of
Russia to-day than we do, and always will, despite
the fact that we talked much of friendship for Russia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
and Siberia. England said little, but acted with
troops in supporting the anti-Bolshevist forces.</p>

<p>I consider the Siberian campaign a failure, for the
simple reason that what we failed to do in Siberia
will eventually aid Germany. Germany is bound to
penetrate Russia economically, and control the
country financially unless we change our tactics. We
went to Siberia to checkmate Germany&mdash;we have
aided her. This is because the Russian will never
take us seriously again&mdash;we are regarded nationally
as a &#8220;bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went into Siberia with armed forces to help
Russia, and did little but talk, nurse the railroad,
distribute pamphlets, and show pictures to prove to
the Russians what a great nation we were&mdash;at home.
Among the pamphlets we distributed was one in
Russian, entitled: &#8220;If you want a republic we will
show you how to build one.&#8221;</p>

<p>In effect, we told them that everything we did was
right, and everything that they did was wrong. The
wiser ones smiled, shook their heads, and tolerated
us. How, they asked, are you showing us the way
to build a republic if every time we submit a problem
to you, you throw up your hands and say: &#8220;We cannot
advise you, for that would be interfering. This
is something you must settle for yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reason why, when the Siberian situation
developed its own peculiar problem after the
armistice, the Siberian expedition could not have
been increased to a strength which would make it
possible to protect itself, and carried out a definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
policy in regard to Russia. If we could formulate no
policy for Siberia which seemed to fit our national
aims toward Russia and Siberia, our expedition
should have been withdrawn.</p>

<p>I feel that none of the things we set out to accomplish
in Siberia has been accomplished. And many of
the things we wished to prevent, have been carried
out by Bolshevist forces&mdash;at least we have had little
if any hand in checking Bolshevist activities.</p>

<p>The American expedition degenerated from a military
expedition into a political expedition, or probably
what might be termed a diplomatic expedition.
I maintain that it is a great error in governmental
policy to attempt to turn a soldier into a diplomat, or
a diplomat into a soldier. The soldier should not
be called in until the policy of the nation had been
clearly defined, and then the soldier should act, free
from all political complications. An American military
expedition should never leave our shores, till
the government can tell its commander what to do,
and his instructions should be defined in terms of
action.</p>

<p>If Washington did not want to restrain &#8220;agitating
peasants&#8221; by force of arms, it never should have
allowed our forces to enter Siberia, or to remain a
day after the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>To land an expedition in a country, and then attempt
to tell the country that we do not intend to
interfere in its internal affairs, is absurd.</p>

<p>If a foreign power, during the Civil War, had
landed military forces on the Atlantic coast, no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
how much that power had assured us that it did
not intend to interfere, we would have demanded
instant withdrawal. And in replying to assurances
of a non-interfering intention, we would have replied:
&#8220;You have already interfered&mdash;you are on
our territory, and if you do not come to aid us, our
enemy will be able to assert to his adherents, that
you have come to aid him. You must do one of two
things&mdash;fight with us or against us. We mistrust
you, for we feel that if things should go against
either side in this quarrel, you would throw your
forces in with what appeared to be the winning
side.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in Russia, and Siberia to-day, we are inclined
to think that the issue is between Bolshevism
and non-Bolshevism. It is a greater issue than that&mdash;it
is a fight between an imperial form of government
and a republican form of government.</p>

<p>When Maximilian set up his Empire in Mexico,
we regarded it as an unfriendly act, and drove him
out; and our own Monroe policy forbids foreign
powers from landing forces for aggression or anything
else in any part of the Western Hemisphere.
No matter what a European chancellory might assert
as the motive for sending a military expedition
to this side of the world, we would regard it as an
unfriendly act.</p>

<p>I wish it borne in mind that I am not attacking
the administration for sending an expedition; but I
am criticising the sending of an expedition; and
having no policy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>We sat around all winter in Siberia, refusing to
oppose &#8220;agitating peasants,&#8221; or &#8220;anti-Kolchak
forces,&#8221; and when Spring came our own men were
killed and captured at the Suchan Mines, not far
from Vladivostok, by agitating peasants and anti-Kolchak
forces, now revealed as Bolshevists. The
errors of statesmen are corrected with the lives of
soldiers.</p>

<p>What should we have done in Siberia? We should
have done the only thing a military expedition is supposed
to do&mdash;prevent disorder, insure safety to the
inhabitants who go about their business, and demand
that the Russians in such places as we occupied get
busy with plans for government, and till they did so,
go on and administer local government with their
co&ouml;peration in accordance with our own ideas, and
with our future intentions toward the people clearly
stated and pledged.</p>

<p>That sounds like a big order. But those are the
things we were expected to do by all hands&mdash;Russians,
and our Allied interventionists. Also, no doubt,
the decent element of our own country expected such
action&mdash;and thought it was being done.</p>

<p>We have lost face in Asia, and if we ever find we
wish to make a threatening gesture in that direction,
we will not be taken very seriously till we have
carried out the threat at large cost in blood and
treasure. We may never have to make that threat,
but we may be menaced from that direction some
day, because Germany will expand in that direction,
if not territorially at once, at least economically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
And one thing we must realize&mdash;Germany has far
better chances of merging with Asia than we have,
because Asia understands the German idea.</p>

<p>Asia does not understand our ideas or ideals in
government, and since seeing us operate in Siberia,
is more puzzled with us than ever. Asia realizes
our strength, and fears us for that reason alone; but
she has seen our strength poorly demonstrated on
her own soil, and she feels inclined to say: &#8220;Pooh!
The giant of the Western Hemisphere is afraid of
us, after all. He shakes his fist, but does not want
to fight, he does not want to exert himself in this
direction, he does not want to control us in any
way. He is a good-natured giant, and there is no
reason why we should fear his bluster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asia is saying that herself. If ever the day comes
when another power whispers to her that she is
right about us, and that if she will join up with them
we can be driven out of Asia and kept out, then Asia
will in time be a serious menace to our peace and
safety, and our existence as a nation with Western
ideals.</p>

<p>We may think Asia is &#8220;slow&#8221;&mdash;in many ways Asia
can out-think us. The land that had Confucius, the
land of soul-searching which is India, the land of the
Grand Lamas which is Thibet, the land which produced
Buddha&mdash;they cannot be fooled.</p>

<p>We had better take care that we do not legislate
ourselves into a feeling of security, till we have
educated Asia as to our aims and purposes and feel
that Asia feels as we do about the things we prize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
the most. Not till that time is it possible to federate
the world, though we must attempt such a federation.
Though the League of Nations may fail as a
preventive of wars, it will serve humanity by revealing
secret enmities and anti-American ideas, it will
make for discussion of world interests, it will clarify
our purposes, it will serve to educate nations about
other nations. Though it never gets beyond anything
but an international debating society (assuming
that fact for the sake of argument) it gives the
nations of the world a chance to go somewhere with
their grievances. It will do much for the United
States in making us internationally minded, though
nationally conscious. No doubt President Wilson is
actuated by some such idea in his willingness to forego
many things he would like to have gained at the
Peace Conference, if only the League of Nations is
saved as an idea.</p>

<p>The nations need a safety valve. The old diplomacy
served to conceal national aims and aspirations,
either good or bad. The consequence was that
one-half the world found the other half arrayed
against it, and did not suspect it, till the war broke.</p>

<p>Asia must not be allowed to misunderstand us,
and we must not misunderstand Asia. Europe, with
the same civilization, got into conflict, by diplomatic
concealment of opposing ideas. Frank discussions
under the old-style diplomacy was something in the
nature of an affront&mdash;we could not be frank with
each other till we were at war. We need to look
facts in the face, to argue a little more and fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
less. We cannot assert that a condition exists merely
because we wish it existed, we must tell the truth to
Asia about ourselves and we must not be afraid to
tell Asia what we want Asia to know, even though
Asia may resent it. We must educate Asia to our
ideas, or she will educate us to hers&mdash;which is subjection.</p>

<p>Asia&#8217;s history is a history of great conquests with
intervening periods of degeneration. She rises and
falls like tides between cycles of time. We have
known her during a period in which she has bent the
neck to the white man in various ways.</p>

<p>We have been teaching her to build modern machinery
for construction and destruction. The old
jig-saw geography of Asia is being juggled into a
new pattern, and seems ready for a new era and a
new master. She may develop another Ghengis
Khan, another Tartar horde, (civilized in modern
warfare this time) and our Chinese wall which we
call the Pacific may not protect us.</p>

<p>This is not &#8220;Yellow Perilism&#8221; as we have understood
it heretofore, but a consideration of the possibilities
in all Asia during the next hundred years,
under the &aelig;gis of a sort of Prussianism in a new
form, welding China, India, Persia, Asiatic Russia
and all the East to an idea which combats the American
ideal of government.</p>

<p>As I have said, Asia can think. She almost has a
league of nations in her religion (the various sects
agree among themselves better than they all do with
Christianity) and religion offers a splendid means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
communicating an idea to numberless people who are
otherwise illiterate. The Buddhist Mongol from
Manchuria can carry a message to the far-off temples
of the Himalayas, without cable tolls or cable
censors.</p>

<p>Russia aflame with Bolshevism startled us. The
propaganda had been going on a long time before we
considered it a serious menace, because we did not
believe that so many people could be trained to such
absurd ideas by absurd promises. We did not understand
the possibilities for united destruction in a
vast, ignorant and subject people. We must understand
Asia&mdash;or our children&#8217;s children will wash the
pots in Asiatic sculleries.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
